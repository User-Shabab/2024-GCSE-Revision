# Topic 5 - Forces

## Scalar and Vector Quantities
```
Scalar values only have magnitude
Eg:
Mass
Temperature
Speed
Energy

Vector quantities have magnitude and direction
Eg:
Displacement
Weight
Force
Velocity

A vector quantity may be represented by an arrow. The length of
the arrow represents the magnitude, and the direction of the arrow
the direction of the vector quantity
```

Forces are a push or pull acting on an object

Can be: Contact and Non-contact Forces

```
Contact Forces
Eg ( friction, air resistance, tension and normal contact force)
Non-contact Forces
Eg (gravitational force, electrostatic force and magnetic force)
```

Normal contact force only happen if 2 objects in direct contact

Weight is measured using a calibrated spring-balance (a newtonmeter).

## Resultant forces
```
A number of forces acting on an object may be replaced by a single
force that has the same effect as all the original forces acting
together. This single force is called the resultant force.

Use free body diagrams to describe qualitatively examples
where several forces lead to a resultant force on an object,
including balanced forces when the resultant force is zero.
```

## Values for speed
```
walking ̴ 1.5 m/s
running ̴ 3 m/s
cycling ̴ 6 m/s
sound in air is 330 m/s
```

## Equations

weight  = mass  × gravitational field strength

work done = force × distance

F = ke

F = pA

s = vt

a = (v - u) ÷ t

v<sup>2</sup> −  u<sup>2</sup> = 2as

F = ma

p = mv

M = Fd


## Pressure and pressure differences in fluids
```
A partially (or totally) submerged object experiences a greater
pressure on the bottom surface than on the top surface. This
creates a resultant force upwards. This force is called the upthrust.

Atmospheric pressure
The atmosphere is a thin layer (relative to the size of the Earth) of
air round the Earth. The atmosphere gets less dense with
increasing altitude.
Air molecules colliding with a surface create atmospheric pressure.
The number of air molecules (and so the weight of air) above a
surface decreases as the height of the surface above ground level
increases. So as height increases there is always less air above a
surface than there is at a lower height. So atmospheric pressure
decreases with an increase in height.
```

# Topic 6 - Waves

## Transverse and Longitudinal
```
Transverse (NOT NEED MEDIUM): Direction of energy transfer is perpendicular to oscillations
Eg: Ripple waves, EM waves, S-waves

Longitudinal (NEEDS A MEDIUM): Direction of energy transfer is parallel to oscillations
Eg: Sound waves, P-waves
```

## Features of a wave
```
Amplitude
Frequency
Wavelength
Period

Period = 1 ÷ Frequency
v = fλ
```

## Sound & Seismic Waves

**KNOW HOW SONAR WORKS**

Human ear only hear **20Hz-20KHz**

P-waves pass thru all of Earth while S-waves can't pass thru liquid core

### Light rays
```
If light reflect off smooth thing it's "Specular reflection"
So angle of reflection be same as angle of incidence relative to the normal.
But if rough then "Diffuse reflection"
```

## EM Waves

```
RADIO
MICRO
INFRA-RED
VISIBLE LIGHT
ULTRA VIOLET
X-RAYS
GAMMA RAYS
```

### Uses
```
RADIO - Phones, TV, Wifi
MICRO - Cooking
INFRA-RED - Cooking
VISIBLE LIGHT - Vision
ULTRA VIOLET - Tanning
X-RAYS - Medical sacns
GAMMA RAYS - Sterilising, Medical treatments
```

# Topic 7 - Magnetism & Electromagnetism

# Topic 8 - Space Physics

## Dem Planets in de solar system
```
MERCURY
VENUS
EARTH
MARS
JUPITER
SATURN
URANUS
NEPTUNE
```

## Nebula's journey to somethin
```
Nebula (dust particles attracted with gravity)
Cloud become hotter and denser till fusion start to occur
Grows to main sequence star and stay stable long as p.a from fusion balanced w/ grav. pull
When dies, outward p.a++ so expand to either RED GIANT (our sun size) // SUPER RED GIANT
RED GIANT turn to WHITE DAWRF when all fuel go out then Black dawrf when cooled
SUPER RED GIANT go explode to supernova leaving dense stuff called NEUTRON STAR or more dense stuff called BLACK HOLE
(SUPERNOVA BE MAKING HEAVY ELEMENTS AND NEW NEBULA TOO)
```

## Satellites
```
Geostationary satellites be oribittin in a circle aorund earth (above same point on equator)
Orbit circular so speed be constant but velocity be changing (coz direction be changin)
Hence accelerating but not getting any faster
Used for GPS, TV, & Comm.s

Centripetal force be actin to centre of orbit so velocity dir. be  tangent so these 2 perpendicular to each other

If satellite have eliptical orbit then it be gettin faster as gettin closer
Used for weather and recon.
```

## Red Shift & Big Bang Theory
```
Red shift - when wavelength of light from distant galaxies be stretched coz galaxies moving away from us
Doppler effect - apparent change in freq.//wavelength of a wave due to relative motion of source & observer
```
