# Topic 6 - The Rate and Extent of Chemical Change

## Terms
```
Collision theory=chemical reactions occur only when reacting particles collide with each other & with sufficient E.
Activation energy= minimum amount of energy that particles must have to react
```

## Calculate rate of reaciton
```
Mean rate of reaction = Quantity of product//reactant formed ÷ Time taken
```

## Factors.affect(rates of chemical reactions)
```
concentrations of reactants in solution
pressure of reacting gases
surface area of solid reactants
temperature
presence of catalysts

"increases the frequency of collisions and so increases the rate of reaction"
" increases the frequency of collisions and makes the collisions more energetic..."

Catalysts increase the rate of reaction by providing a different
pathway for the reaction that has a lower activation energy.

# Topic 7 - Organic Chemistry

## Hydrocarbons

Longer chains of hydrocarbons have:
- [ ] Higher Viscosity
- [ ] Lower Flammability
- [ ] Higher boiling points

Meth_ == 1 Carbons

Eth_ == 2 Carbons

Prop_ == 3 Carbons

But_ == 4 Carbons

Pent_ == 5 Carbons

Complete combustion
```
Hydrocarbon + Oxygen → Water + Carbon Dioxide
```

Can do incomplete combustion (add on carbon and carbon monoxide on products side)

### Alkanes

General formula: C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>

Saturated since all hydrogens bond with carbons

NO CHANGE TO BROMINE WATER

### Alkenes

General formula: C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>

Unsaturated since double bond restricts hydrogen numbers

TURN BROMINE WATER COLORLESS

CAN BE COMBINED TO MAKE POLYMERS

REACTIONS
```
(With phosphoric catalyst, 300°C)
Alkene + Steam → Alcohol (HYDRATION)

WILL GIVE SMOKY FLAME IN INCOMPLETE COMBUSTION

(With nickel catalyst, 60°C)
Alkene + Hydrogen → Alkane (HYDROGENATION)
```

### Fractional Distillation (Crude Oils)
```
Evaporation
Condensation
Collection
```

### Cracking (Crude Oils)
```
Steam cracking {
  Heat to very high temperature} 800°C}
Catalytic cracking {
  Heat 550°C
  Pass over powdered aluminum oxide catalyst}
```

## Alocohols

General formula: C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+1</sub>OH

Add on a CH<sub>2</sub> as it increases

### Reactions

Alcohols reacting with oxidising agent produce a carboxylic acid

Alcohols with sodium produce hydrogen

Alcohols with water produce neutral solutions

Alcohols with air and heat produce carbon dioxide and water

### Fermentation
Conditions:
```
A temperature of 25-35°C
A solution that is slightly acidic
In the absence of oxygen (anaerobic)
```

### Uses
```
Methanol: Chemical feedstock, Industrial ethanol
Ethanol: Alcohol, Fuel to burn, Solvent
Propanol: Fuel to burn, Solvent
Butanol: Fuel to burn, Solvent
```

## Carboxylic Acids

PARTIALLY IONISE IN WATER SINCE A WEAK ACID

General formula: C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+1</sub>COOH.

Add on a CH<sub>2</sub> as it increases

### Reactions
```
(With sulfuric catalyst)
Ethanoic acid + ethanol → ethyl ethanoate + water

REACTING WITH WATER PRODUCES:
A salt
Carbon dioxide
Water

When carboxylic acids react with water, they dissolve to give solutions with an acidic pH.
```

## All Reactions
```
Hydrocarbon + Oxygen → Water + Carbon Dioxide
Alkene + Oxygen → Carbon + Carbon Monoxide + Carbon Dioxide + Water
Alkenes + Steam ⇌ Alcohols (Hydration)
Alkenes + Hydrogen → Alkane (Hydrogenation)
Acid + Metal Carbonate → Metal Salt + Carbon Dioxide + Water
Alcohol + Carboxylic Acid ⇌ Ester + Water + Carbon Dioxide
Glucose → Ethanol + Carbon Dioxide (Fermentation)
```
## Polymers

### Addition polymerisation
```
In addition polymerisation reactions, many small molecules
(monomers) join together to form very large molecules (polymers).
For example:
In addition polymers the repeating unit has the same atoms as the
monomer because no other molecule is formed in the reaction.

Functional group C=C in the monomers
```

### Condensation polymerisation
```
Involves monomers with two functional groups. When these types of monomers react they join
together, usually losing small molecules such as water, and so the
reactions are called condensation reactions.
```

### Amino acids
```
Amino acids have two different functional groups in a molecule.
Amino acids react by condensation polymerisation to produce
polypeptides
```

### DNA and other naturally occurring polymers

# Topic 8 - Chemical Analysis

## Terms
```
Formulations == a mixture that has been designed as a useful
product
Pure substance == a single element or compound, not mixed with any other substance
(everyday language) pure substance can mean a substance that is unadulterated and in its natural state
```

## Test for gases
```
Oxygen - Glowing splint relight
Hydrogen - Lit splint gives squeaky pop
Carbon Dioxide - Turn Limewater cloudy
Chlorine - Damp litmus paper turns bleached white
```

## Chromatography
```

## Identifying positive (metal) ions
```
Flame tests can be used to identify some metal ions (cations).
Lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium and copper compounds
produce distinctive colours in flame tests:
• lithium compounds result in a crimson flame
• sodium compounds result in a yellow flame
• potassium compounds result in a lilac flame
• calcium compounds result in an orange-red flame
• copper compounds result in a green flame.
If a sample containing a mixture of ions is used some flame colours
can be masked.

Sodium hydroxide solution can be used to identify some metal ions
(cations).
Solutions of aluminium, calcium and magnesium ions form white
precipitates when sodium hydroxide solution is added but only the
aluminium hydroxide precipitate dissolves in excess sodium
hydroxide solution.
Solutions of copper(II), iron(II) and iron(III) ions form coloured
precipitates when sodium hydroxide solution is added.
Copper(II) forms a blue precipitate, iron(II) a green precipitate and
iron(III) a brown precipitate.
```

## Identifying negative ions
```
Halide ions in solution produce precipitates with silver nitrate
solution in the presence of dilute nitric acid. Silver chloride is white,
silver bromide is cream and silver iodide is yellow.

Sulfate ions in solution produce a white precipitate with barium
chloride solution in the presence of dilute hydrochloric acid.

Carbonates react with dilute acids to form carbon dioxide gas.
Carbon dioxide can be identified with limewater.
```
