# Topic 7 - Ecology

## Terms
```
Individual organisms are the smallest part of an ecosystem.
Populations of individual organisms make up a single species.
Communities are made up of populations of different species.
An ecosystem is the interaction of a community of living organisms
(biotic) with the non-living (abiotic) parts of their environment.

```

## Factors affecting communities:
```
Abiotic (non-living) factors which can affect a community are:
• light intensity
• temperature
• moisture levels
• soil pH and mineral content
• wind intensity and direction
• carbon dioxide levels for plants
• oxygen levels for aquatic animals

Biotic (living) factors which can affect a community are:
• availability of food
• new predators arriving
• new pathogens
• one species outcompeting another so the numbers are no longer
sufficient to breed
```

## Interdependance examples
```
Food
Shelter
Seed dispersal
Pollination
```

## Food chains show the feeding relationships within a community:
```
Food chains nearly always begin with a producer that makes its own food. 
This is usually a green plant or algae that can photosynthesise.
Producers are eaten by animals called primary consumers.
Primary consumers are eaten by secondary consumers.
Secondary consumers are eaten by tertiary consumers.
An apex predator is at the top of the food chain.

## Using Quadrats to Estimate a Population Size
```
Divide the habitat up into a series of quadrat-sized cells.
Randomly select a given number of cells, then go out into the habitat and place the quadrat in these positions.
To evaluate the quadrat contents, either count the number of individual organisms of interest
The samples from the quadrat are used to estimate the total population in a given area:

population = number counted x (total survey area / area sampled)
```

## The Carbon Cycle
```
Carbon is removed from the atmosphere by producers (e.g. algae) who use it in photosynthesis.
By consuming plant matter, animals obtain carbon compounds.
Carbon returned to atmosphere (as carbon dioxide) because of respiration that happen in plant & animal cells.
When animals & plants die, decomposers return carbon locked in their bodies back to the atmosphere via decay.
Combustion of fossil fuels is another source of carbon entry into the atmosphere.
```

## The Water Cycle
```
Water evaporates from the Earth’s surface, before rising up into the atmosphere.
Once in the atmosphere, the water vapour cools and condenses into either rain or snow.
This eventually returns to the Earth’s surface.
The rain or snow will either become surface runoff (water flowing off land) or will travel
through the earth as ground water.
Plants take up water through their roots.
```

## Rate of decay
```
Moisture availability
Oxygen availability
Temperature
```

## Biogas generators
```
Anaerobic decay happens when the oxygen supply is insufficient (not enough),
and results in the production of biogas, which is mainly methane.
Biogas generators produce methane gas, which is used as a fuel.
It can also be used to produce slurry which can also be used as a fertiliser.
It is crucial that temperatures are maintained at a suitable level and that
oxygen is not allowed to enter the site of fermentation.
```

## Practical - Temperature & Milk Decay
```
Use a water bath to heat all of the components to a given temperature.
Mix the milk, sodium carbonate and Cresol red. The resulting solution should be purple.
Add lipase to the solution and start timing.
When the solution turns yellow, stop timing.
Repeat using different temperatures.
