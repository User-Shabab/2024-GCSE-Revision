# Topic 7 - Ecology

## Terms
```
Individual organisms are the smallest part of an ecosystem.
Populations of individual organisms make up a single species.
Communities are made up of populations of different species.
An ecosystem is the interaction of a community of living organisms
(biotic) with the non-living (abiotic) parts of their environment.

## Plants.compete w/ others for:
```
Minerals
Light
Space
Water
```

## Factors affecting communities:
```
Abiotic (non-living) factors which can affect a community are:
• light intensity
• temperature
• moisture levels
• soil pH and mineral content
• wind intensity and direction
• carbon dioxide levels for plants
• oxygen levels for aquatic animals

Biotic (living) factors which can affect a community are:
• availability of food
• new predators arriving
• new pathogens
• one species outcompeting another so the numbers are no longer
sufficient to breed
```

## Interdependance examples
```
Food
Shelter
Seed dispersal
Pollination
```

## Food chains show the feeding relationships within a community:
```
Food chains nearly always begin with a producer that makes its own food. 
This is usually a green plant or algae that can photosynthesise.
Producers are eaten by animals called primary consumers.
Primary consumers are eaten by secondary consumers.
Secondary consumers are eaten by tertiary consumers.
An apex predator is at the top of the food chain.
