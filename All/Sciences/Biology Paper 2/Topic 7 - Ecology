# Topic 7 - Ecology

## Terms
```
Individual organisms are the smallest part of an ecosystem.
Populations of individual organisms make up a single species.
Communities are made up of populations of different species.
An ecosystem is the interaction of a community of living organisms
(biotic) with the non-living (abiotic) parts of their environment.

## Factors affecting communities:
```
Abiotic (non-living) factors which can affect a community are:
• light intensity
• temperature
• moisture levels
• soil pH and mineral content
• wind intensity and direction
• carbon dioxide levels for plants
• oxygen levels for aquatic animals

Biotic (living) factors which can affect a community are:
• availability of food
• new predators arriving
• new pathogens
• one species outcompeting another so the numbers are no longer
sufficient to breed
