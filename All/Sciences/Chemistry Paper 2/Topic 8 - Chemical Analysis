# Topic 8 - Chemical Analysis

## Terms
```
Formulations == a mixture that has been designed as a useful
product
Pure substance == a single element or compound, not mixed with any other substance
(everyday language) pure substance can mean a substance that is unadulterated and in its natural state
```

## Test for gases
```
Oxygen - Glowing splint relight
Hydrogen - Lit splint gives squeaky pop
Carbon Dioxide - Turn Limewater cloudy
Chlorine - Damp litmus paper turns bleached white
```

## Chromatography

## Identifying positive (metal) ions
```
Flame tests can be used to identify some metal ions (cations).
Lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium and copper compounds
produce distinctive colours in flame tests:
• lithium compounds result in a crimson flame
• sodium compounds result in a yellow flame
• potassium compounds result in a lilac flame
• calcium compounds result in an orange-red flame
• copper compounds result in a green flame.
If a sample containing a mixture of ions is used some flame colours
can be masked.

Sodium hydroxide solution can be used to identify some metal ions
(cations).
Solutions of aluminium, calcium and magnesium ions form white
precipitates when sodium hydroxide solution is added but only the
aluminium hydroxide precipitate dissolves in excess sodium
hydroxide solution.
Solutions of copper(II), iron(II) and iron(III) ions form coloured
precipitates when sodium hydroxide solution is added.
Copper(II) forms a blue precipitate, iron(II) a green precipitate and
iron(III) a brown precipitate.
```

## Identifying negative ions
```
Halide ions in solution produce precipitates with silver nitrate
solution in the presence of dilute nitric acid. Silver chloride is white,
silver bromide is cream and silver iodide is yellow.

Sulfate ions in solution produce a white precipitate with barium
chloride solution in the presence of dilute hydrochloric acid.

Carbonates react with dilute acids to form carbon dioxide gas.
Carbon dioxide can be identified with limewater.

## Chemical Analysis vs Instrumental Analysis
```
Chemical.pro {
Simple to do
!Specialist equipment required

Chemical.con {
Will use up the sample

Instrumental.pro {
Can detect small amounts
Very fast//rapid
Accurate++
Provide lot of info. from small sample

Instrumental.con {
Machines == $++
Require specialists

Instrumental.eg {
NMR (Nuclear Magenetic Resonance)
IR Spectroscopy ($-- (*))
Mass Spectrometer (electrons bombing)
Flame Emission Spectroscopy
```

### Flame Emission Spectroscopy
```
High tech. v. of flame test
Measure light.wavelength given
Compares w/ reference spectra
Data.used {
  Identify metal ion in sample
  Determine conc.(metal ion) in dil. sol.
Identifying ions {
  Colored light from vaporised sample can be split to produce emmission spectrum
  Diff. lines look like colored barcode
  Each metal be unique
  Readings used to plot a calibrative curve
```
