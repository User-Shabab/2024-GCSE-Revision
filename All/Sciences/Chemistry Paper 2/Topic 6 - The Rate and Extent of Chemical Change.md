# Topic 6 - The Rate and Extent of Chemical Change

## Terms
```
Collision theory=chemical reactions occur only when reacting particles collide with each other & with sufficient E.
Activation energy= minimum amount of energy that particles must have to react
```

## Calculate rate of reaciton
```
Mean rate of reaction = Quantity of product//reactant formed รท Time taken
```

## Factors.affect(rates of chemical reactions)
```
concentrations of reactants in solution
pressure of reacting gases
surface area of solid reactants
temperature
presence of catalysts

"increases the frequency of collisions and so increases the rate of reaction"
" increases the frequency of collisions and makes the collisions more energetic..."

Catalysts increase the rate of reaction by providing a different
pathway for the reaction that has a lower activation energy.
