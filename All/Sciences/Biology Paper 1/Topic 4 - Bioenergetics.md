# Topic 4 - Bioenergetics

## Photosynthesis

### Use of glucose in plants

- [ ] Respiration
- [ ] Making cellulose
- [ ] Making amino acids
- [ ] Stored as oils//fats (to lipids for storing in seeds)
- [ ] Stored as starch (stored for later)

### Limiting Factors on rate of photosynthesis
- [ ] Light
- [ ] Number of chlorophyll
- [ ] Carbon dioxide concentration
- [ ] Temperature

## Respirations

### Aerobic

With oxygen. Equation below is used by both plants and animals.

```
Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon Dioxide + Water
```

### Anaerobic

Without oxygen. Provides less energy.

Humans:
```
Glucose → Lactic acid
```

Plants and Yeast (fermentation):
```
Glucose → Ethanol + Carbon Dioxide
```
