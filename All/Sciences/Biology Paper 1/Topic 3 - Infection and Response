# Topic 3 - Infection and Response

## Diseases

### Viruses

**TMV:**
```
Symptoms: Mosaic patterns on leaf. Parts discoloured. Means !photosynthesis thus !growth.
Spread: Touching other leaves//contanct.
Prevention: Cut off // Vaccine.
```

**HIV:**
```
Symptoms: Flu-like. !Appears after long time. Leads to AIDS.
Spread: Bodily fluids being shared (like needles).
Prevention: Barriers // Antiretroviral drugs
```

**Measles:**
```
Symptoms: Red skin rash. Signs of fever. Can lead to pneumonia and encaphalitis.
Spread: Droplets in air. Airborn.
Prevention: Most people vaccinated at youth.
```

### Bacteria

**Salmonella:**
```
Symptoms: Fever, stomach cramps, vomiting, diarrhoea.
Spread: Food poinsoning from contaminated food (chickens)
Prevention: Vaccination on poultry & hygenic food.
```

**Gonorrhoea:**
```
Symptoms: Yellow//green discharge in urine (& pain).
Spread: Sexual contact//unprotected intercourse. (STD)
Prevention: Antibiotics to treat // Barriers.
```

### Protists

**Malaria:**
```
Symptoms: Repeated episodes of fever. Fatal.
Spread: Mosquitoes when they feed on humans.
Prevention: Insecticides & mosquito nets.
```

### Fungi

**Rose Black Spot:**
```
Symptoms: Purple/Black spots develop on rose plants' leaves. Then turn yellow and drop.
Spread: Water & Airborn. Also by contact.
Prevention: Fungicides. Stripping leaf from plant & destroy.
```

## Developing Drugs

### Pre-clinical testing part 1

Drug tested on human cells and tissues in lab

### Pre-clinical testing part 2

Drug tested on live animals

Test for : efficacy, toxicity, dosage

### Clinical testing

Tested on healthy human volunteers

Test for any side effects

Low dosage initially

Then on patients if successful

Use placebo, and double-blind trial it hence no bias

Peer-reviewed so no false claims


## Plant diseases and defences

### Common signs of disease
```
Stunted growth
Spots on leaves
Patches of decay (rot)
Abnormal growths
Malformed stems//leaves
Discoloration
```

### Identify disease
```
Gardening manual
Gardening website
Take to a lab
Use testing kit with monoclonal antibodies
```

### Physical defences
```
Waxy cuticle as barrier
Cell walls of cellulose
Layers of dead cells around stem (bark)
```

### Chemical defences
```
Produce antibacterial chemicals
Produce poisons
```

### Mechanical defences
```
Thorns and hairs
Droop or curl when touched
Mimic other plants
```
