# Topic 1 - Cell Biology

## Cell Structure

### Animal cells
```
Nucleus: Contains genetic material that controls cell's activites
Cytoplasm: Substance where chemical reactions happen
Membrane: Holds cell together and controls what goes in and out
Mitochondria: Where aerobic respiration takes place
Ribosomes: Where protein synthesis takes place
```

### Plant cells
```
Nucleus: Contains genetic material that controls cell's activites
Cytoplasm: Substance where chemical reactions happen
Membrane: Holds cell together and controls what goes in and out
Mitochondria: Where aerobic respiration takes place
Ribosomes: Where protein synthesis takes place
Cell Wall: Rigid structure (of cellulose), supports and strengthens cell
Permanent Vacuole: Contain cell sap, weak concentration of sugars and salts
Chloroplasts: Where photosynthesis occurs, contain chlorophyll
```

### Bacterial cells
```
Circular strand of DNA and Plasmid: Contains genetic material that controls cell's activites
Cytoplasm: Substance where chemical reactions happen
Membrane: Holds cell together and controls what goes in and out
Cell Wall: Rigid structure, supports and strengthens cell
Ribosomes: Where protein synthesis takes place
```

## Microscopes

### Light
```
Cheaper
Lower resolution
Lower magnification
Less power needed
Colored images
Not much training needed
Specimen can be alive
```

### Electron
```
Expensive
Higher resolution
Higher magnification
More power needed
Black and white images
Much training needed
Specimen be dead
```

## Specialised cells

### Sperm Cells
```
Long tail and streamlined to help it swim
Lot of mitochondria in middle section for energy
Acrosome in head to digest through egg cell membrane
```

### Nerve Cells (animals)
```
Long to cover great distance
Branched connections at ends to form network
```

### Muscle Cells (animals)
```
Long hence more space to contract
Lots of mitochondria for energy for contraction
```

### Root Hair Cells (plants)
```
Long hairs hence big surface area
Thin cell wall allows quicker absorption rates
```

### Phloem and Xylem Cells (plants)
```
Cells are long and joined end to end
Xylem is hollow and phloem have few sub-cellular structures
Substances can easily flow through them
```

## Exchange substances

### Alveoli
```
Large surface area
Moist lining for dissolving gases
Thin walls
Good blood supplies from capillaries surrounding it
```

### Small Intestine
```
Have microvilli on villi hence increase surface area
Single layer of surface cells
Villi have good blood supply
```

### Leaves
```
Have stomata for gases
Have spaces inside for larger surface area
Guard cells maintain income of gases
```
