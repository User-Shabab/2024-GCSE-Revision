# Topic 1 - Energy

## Energy stores

Energy can never be created nor destroyed, rather only transferred.

**Stores:**

**Kinetic Energy**

<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>mv<sup>2</sup>

**Gravitational Potential Energy**

E = mgh

**Elastic Potential Energy**

<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>ke<sup>2</sup>

**Thermal Energy (SHC)**

ΔE = mcΔT

## Energy transfers

Energy can be transferred by:

Heating

Electrically

Mechanically

Radiation

## SHC Practical

## Power and efficiency

## Energy sources
