# Topic 5 - Homeostasis and Response

## Nervous vs Endocrine System

### Nervous system
```
Triggers rapid response.
Uses electrical signals that are carried by neurones.
Response is very short.
Acts on a very precise part of the body.
```

### Endocrine (hormonal) system
```
Triggers a slower response.
Uses chemical messengers that are carried by blood.
Response can be long-lasting.
Can act on large areas of the body.
```

## The Nervous System

### Reflex Arc
```
A stimulus is detected by a receptor
Impulses or electrical signals sent along sensory neurone
Impulses passed along via relay neurone
Impulses travel along motor neurone
Impulse reaches effector where muscle or gland used
```

### Entities
```
CNS: Receives info from receptors and coordinates a response
Synapses: Connection between 2 neurones, using chemical diffusion
Sensory neurones: Carry info from receptors to CNS
Motor neurones: Carry info from CNS to effectors
Effectors: Glands and Muscles that carry out an action
Receptor: Detects change in environment
```

Regulating internal conditions
```
Carbon dioxide levels
Urea concentration (in urine)
Internal body temperature
Blood sugar levels
Water levels
```

Negative feedback
```
When our internal conditions are optimal, the body does not need to respond.
If an internal condition changes and is no longer optimal, this stimulus is detected and the body works to counteract (reverse) the change and return conditions to the optimum.
This process is called negative feedback and needs all of the components of the nervous system to work together.
```

## The Brain

### 3 Main parts

#### Cerebral cortex
```
This part is responsible for conscious thought (e.g. memory, language and intelligence).
```

#### Cerebellum
```
This part is responsible for the muscle coordination.
The cerebellum is important for movement, posture, balance and speech.
```

#### Medulla
```
This part is responsible for unconscious activities (e.g. breathing and heartbeat).
```

### Study methods
```
Electrical stimulation:
Electrical stimulation has also allowed us to treat certain disorders of the brain.
Since nervous system communicate with electrical impulse, electric stimulation used to help treat conditions
eg Parkinson’s disease (cause tremors).

MRI scanners:
MRI stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
MRI scanners have allowed us to learn which areas of the brain are active during different activities
eg moving, speaking and listening.

Brain damage:
By studying patients with brain damage, where part of their brain doesn’t function,
neuroscientists have been able to link particular regions of the brain to particular functions.
```

## The Eye

### Parts of the eye

#### Retina
```
Packed with receptor cells, which are sensitive to both the brightness (light intensity) and the colour of light
```

#### Iris
```
Controls pupil diameter and the quantity of light reaching the retina
```

#### Pupil
```
A hole in the centre of the iris, through which light passes
```

#### Suspensory ligaments
```
A ring of fibres that connect ciliary muscles to the lens
```

#### Ciliary muscles
```
A ring of smooth muscle that changes the shape of the lens to focus light
```

#### Optic nerve
```
Transmits visual information, in the form of electrical impulses, from the retina to the brain
```

#### Sclera
```
The white of the eye; the opaque protective outer layer
```

#### Cornea
```
The transparent frontal portion of the eye responsible for refracting light
```

## Controlling Body Temperature

### Thermoregulation

#### Too cold
```
Muscle contractions increase, causing shivering.
Hairs stand on end.
Blood vessels constrict to reduce blood flow in capillaries (vasoconstriction). {
  If we are too cold, then the muscular walls contract.
  This is called vasoconstriction.
  This reduces the blood flow to the skin surface and heat energy is kept inside the body. }
```

#### Too hot
```
Sweat is released from sweat glands under the skin.
Hairs lie flat.
Blood vessels dilate to allow more blood to enter capillaries that pass close to the skin surface (vasodilation). {
  If we are too hot, then the muscular walls relax.
  This is called vasodilation.
  This allows more blood to enter and flow through capillaries close to the skin surface. The excess heat energy is transferred to the surroundings. }
```

### Sweating and Shivering

#### Sweating
```
Sweat glands release water, which covers the skin.
Heat energy from the body is transferred to this water and, when it has enough energy, it evaporates.
As it evaporates, it takes the heat energy with it. This lowers the average temperature of the body.
```

#### Shivering
```
When we are too cold, muscles start to contract automatically. This makes us shiver.
This process requires energy, which is generated through respiration.
Respiration produces heat, which warms us up.
```

### Body Hairs

#### Too cold
```
When we are too cold, the hair erector muscle contracts, causing the hair to stand on end (which pull on the skin giving you goosebumps).
When all the hairs are standing on end, they trap an insulating layer of air around the body.
```

#### Too hot
```
When we are too hot, the hair erector muscle relaxes, causing the hair to lie flat.
```

## The Endocrine System

### Testes (male only)
```
The testes produce testosterone, which controls puberty and sperm production.
```

### Adrenal glands
```
The two adrenal glands are situated above each kidney.
They produce adrenaline, which triggers the ‘fight or flight’ response when an organism is presented with a dangerous situation.
```

### Thyroid gland
```
This gland is in our neck and releases thyroxine.
Thyroxine regulates our metabolism, heart rate and temperature.
```

### Pancreas
```
The pancreas produces insulin and glucagon, both of which are involved in regulating blood glucose levels.
```

### Pituitary gland
```
This is the main endocrine gland or "master gland".
It is found in the brain and is linked to the hypothalamus (part of the brain that receives signals from receptors).
The pituitary gland releases hormones in response to changes detected by the hypothalamus.
Lots of these hormones trigger other glands to release more hormones.
```

### Ovaries (female only)
```
The ovaries produce oestrogen, which controls puberty and is one of the main hormones in the regulation of the menstrual cycle.
```

## Controlling Blood Glucose

If blood glucose levels are too high, this can have a negative impact on osmosis (movement of water between cells) by affecting concentration gradients.

Glucose is important for respiration.
Respiration releases the energy needed by every living cell.

If there is not enough glucose, an organism cannot produce enough energy.

### Diabetes

Type 1 diabetes
In type 1 diabetes, sufferers are unable to produce enough insulin.
The main treatment is to inject insulin when blood glucose levels rise too high.
Sufferers can also manage their diet and exercise regularly to keep blood glucose levels as steady as possible.

Type 2 diabetes
In type 2 diabetes, sufferers can still produce insulin, but their body no longer responds to it.
Because the body no longer responds to insulin, injecting insulin will not help.
Instead, sufferers must manage their diet and exercise regularly to keep blood glucose levels steady.

## The Kidneys

### Controlling water balance

```
Illnesses that cause fever, vomiting or diarrhoea can result in dehydration (the blood's water concentration is too low).
Eating too much salt - This can make the blood ion concentration too high.
Exhalation - Water in the lungs leaves the body in the person’s breath.
Sweating - Water, ions and urea are all lost in sweat.
```

Urea is formed when the digestion of protein results in an excess of (too many) amino acids, which can't be stored in the body.

Deamination - In the liver, these amino acids undergo a process known as deamination, and the waste product is ammonia.

The ammonia is then converted into urea and must be excreted from the body as urine.

### Urine

Ultrafiltration
```
The blood is filtered and all water, urea and salts move into the nephron tubule.
Blood cells and proteins remain in the blood as they are too big to move across the capillary walls.
```

Selective reabsorption
```
Useful substances, including some water, are reabsorbed from the tubule back into the bloodstream.
This leaves all urea, excess salts and excess water in the tubule.
This mixture forms urine, which is collected by the kidneys and travels to the bladder to be stored and then excreted.
```

Too much water
```
The hypothalamus triggers the pituitary gland to stop the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH).
This reduces the permeability of the kidney tubules. This means that less water is reabsorbed back into the bloodstream.
This results in a large volume of dilute urine.
```

Too little water
```
The hypothalamus triggers the pituitary gland to release anti-diuretic hormone (ADH).
This increases the permeability (ability of things to pass through) of the kidney tubules.
This means that more water is reabsorbed back into the bloodstream.
This results in a small volume of concentrated urine.
```

### Dialysis

Machine
```
The patient is linked up to the dialysis machine and their blood flows into the machine.
The machine contains a fluid that is designed to have the optimum concentrations of salts
(e.g. sodium and potassium ions) and glucose, as would be found in a healthy person’s blood.
```

Fluid
```
The patient's blood passes over a partially permeable membrane in the machine that is designed to replicate the kidney tubules.
The dialysis fluid is on the other side of the membrane. A concentration gradient is established, allowing excess ions and urea to diffuse from an area of high concentration in the patient’s blood to an area of low concentration in the dialysis fluid.
```

#### Advantages
```
Dialysis is a life-saving process.
It gives a patient more time to find a donor kidney.
```

#### Disadvantages
```
Lasts 3-4 hours and is needed 3 times a week.
Increases risk of blood clots and infections.
Expensive process.
```

### Transplants

Kidneys can also be transplanted from people who have recently died, provided that they are a tissue match and have registered onto the organ donor register.

Patients receiving a donor kidney often have to take immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their lives.
These drugs suppress the immune system to prevent it from attempting to destroy the foreign cells of the transplanted kidney.

Many patients choose to have a kidney transplant, which often comes from a close relative. Close relatives have a higher chance of being a tissue match.

#### Advantages
```
The patient does not need to have dialysis treatment, which is time-consuming.
Transplants are cheaper than dialysis in the long run.
```

#### Disadvantages
```
The kidney may be rejected by the body.
There can be long waiting lists for kidney transplants.
The patient often has to take immunosuppressant drugs.
These can make a patient more prone to other infections.
```

## Kidney Failure

## Menstrual Cycle

### Hormones
```
Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)
Oestrogen
Luteinising Hormone (LH)
Progesterone
```

### Stages
```
FSH is released by the pituitary gland and causes an egg in the ovary to mature.
FSH also stimulates (encourages) the production of oestrogen.
Oestrogen is produced in the ovaries and causes the development of the thick, spongy uterus lining.
Oestrogen also stimulates the production of Luteinising Hormone (LH) and inhibits (stops) the production of FSH.
LH is produced by the pituitary gland and stimulates the release of a mature egg on Day 14 of the menstrual cycle.
This release is called ovulation.
Progesterone is produced in the ovaries after ovulation.
It is responsible for maintaining the lining of the uterus during days 14-28.
When progesterone levels drop, this triggers the breakdown of the lining. This marks day 1 of the next menstrual cycle.
Progesterone also inhibits (stops) the release of LH and FSH.
```

## Controlling Fertility

### Methods to prevent
```
Progesterone-only pill:
Stimulates the production of thick, sticky mucus, which is very difficult for any sperm to penetrate.
Inhibits the release of FSH, so that eggs don’t mature.
Just as effective as the combined pill but with fewer side effects.

Combined pill:
Contains both oestrogen and progesterone.
By taking every day, enough oestrogen builds up in female body to inhibit production of FSH so no eggs mature.
----
Contraceptive injection:
The contraceptive injection contains progesterone and can last up to three months.

Contraceptive implant:
The contraceptive implant, which can last for 3 years, is inserted under the skin (normally in an arm)
And continuously releases a small amount of progesterone.

Contraceptive patch
The woman places the small contraceptive patch onto the skin, which only has to be changed once a week.
This steadily releases progesterone.
----
Intrauterine devices (IUDs):
This is also known as the coil.
They are small t-shaped devices that are inserted into the uterus.
They work by preventing implantation of an embryo (fertilised egg).
Some intrauterine devices also release progesterone.

Diaphragms:
A diaphragm is a shallow plastic cup, which is inserted into the vagina prior to sexual intercourse and sits at the entrance to the uterus.
It is designed to prevent the sperm from reaching the egg.
It can also be covered in a spermicide to kill the sperm.
----
Condoms (With Spermicide):
Condoms often contain a spermicide, which kills the sperm on release.
----
Sterilisation:

For a man, this involves having the sperm ducts (the tubes between the testes and the penis) cut
So that the sperm are not released on ejaculation.

For a woman, this involves having the fallopian tubes (ducts which connect the ovaries to the uterus) cut
So that an egg cannot reach the uterus.
----
Abstinence:
The only truly effective way (apart from sterilisation) to avoid pregnancy is abstinence.
This simply means that a couple chooses to not have sexual intercourse unless they are ready for a baby.

Timing:
Since a female’s body temperature usually rises during ovulation
some women choose to avoid sexual intercourse on days when they know (or feel) that they are ovulating.
However, sperm can last up to six days inside the woman’s body
so this is not a very reliable or effective method of contraception.
```

### Methods to increase
```
Fertility drugs:
A drug that contains a mixture of FSH and LH can be prescribed by a doctor.
Boosting the levels of FSH and LH can cause an egg to be released in the ovaries.

In-vitro fertilisation (IVF):
FSH & LH are given to stimulate the growth of lots of eggs.
Eggs are collected before being fertilised in a petri dish in a laboratory, using sperm from the father.
These fertilised eggs grow into embryos and are implanted into the woman’s uterus.
```

#### How IVF works
```
FSH and LH are given as fertility drugs to stimulate the growth of large numbers of eggs.
These eggs are then collected before being fertilised in a dish in a laboratory, using sperm from the father.
This is why babies born using this technique are often called ‘test tube babies’.
The fertilised eggs are allowed to grow into embryos. One of these is then implanted into the woman’s uterus.
Sometimes, two embryos are implanted to try to increase the chance of pregnancy.
```

### Disadvantages of fertility treatments
```
The treatments can result in multiple pregnancies (twins or triplets if more embryos are implanted).
This can put both the mother and the children at risk.
Fertility treatments are not guaranteed to work and can be very expensive.
Their success rates are not that high and many attempts may be needed.
It can place high levels of emotional and physical stress on patients and their families.
```

## Thyroxine

Thyroxine is responsible for regulating the growth and brain development of young animals.

Production is regulated by a negative feedback loop. This allows the body to maintain a fairly constant concentration of thyroxine in the blood.
When the concentration of thyroid hormones, such as thyroxine, in the blood is low, the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is increased.
This stimulates the secretion of thyroxine by the thyroid gland.
When the concentration of thyroid hormones in the blood is high, TSH production is decreased.

### Adrenaline

Adrenaline increases heart rate and blood pressure, and dilates the pupils in our eyes.

Adrenaline enlarges the air passages of the lungs and alters metabolism in order to boost the delivery of oxygen and glucose to the brain and the muscles.

In times of fear or stress, adrenaline is part of the so-called ‘fight or flight’ response, preparing the body to move and think quickly in response to danger.

## Plant Hormones

### Auxins
```
Auxins change growth patterns to allow roots and shoots to move either towards or away from a stimulus (change in conditions).
Responses to stimuli that involve directional growth are called tropisms.

Gravitropisms (or geotropisms):
Growth either towards (positively gravitropic) or away from (negatively geotropic) the direction of gravity.

Phototropisms:
These involve growth either towards (positively phototropic) or away from (negatively phototropic) a light source.

-weed killers as they can initiate (start) such rapid growth that the weeds use up all of their resources and die.
-rooting powders (growth supplement) and to promote growth in tissue culture.
```

### Ethene
```
Ethene is a gas that controls cell division and the ripening of fruits.
-food industry
```

### Gibberellins
```
Gibberellins are important in starting off the seed germination (sprouting) process.
-promote flowering, increase fruit size
```

### Light Investigations
```
Step 1:
Place the seeds in petri dishes with damp cotton wool, and leave them in a warm place to germinate (develop).

Step 2:
Randomly divide the petri dishes into three groups and assign each group to one of the following light conditions:
-Full sunlight in a windowsill
-Darkness
-Partial light

Step 3:
Measure the height of each plant every day for a week.

Step 4:
Draw and label biological drawings to show the effects.

Step 5:
The independent variable is the lighting conditions.
The dependent variable is the growth of the plant.

Step 6:
Phototropism can also be demonstrated by placing a seedling in a container that is open only on one side.
```

### Commercial Uses

# Topic 6 - Inheritence, Variation, and Evolution

## Reproduction

### Advantages of Reproduction
```
Advantages of sexual reproduction:
• produces variation in the offspring
• if the environment changes variation gives a survival advantage by natural
selection
• natural selection can be speeded up by humans in selective breeding to
increase food production.

Advantages of asexual reproduction:
• only one parent needed
• more time and energy efficient as do not need to find a mate
• faster than sexual reproduction
• many identical offspring can be produced when conditions are favourable.
```

### Organisms
```
• Malarial parasites reproduce asexually in the human host, but sexually in
the mosquito.
• Many fungi reproduce asexually by spores but also reproduce sexually to
give variation.
• Many plants produce seeds sexually, but also reproduce asexually by
runners such as strawberry plants, or bulb division such as daffodils
```

## DNA and Genome

### Importance of studying human genome
```
• search for genes linked to different types of disease
• understanding and treatment of inherited disorders
• use in tracing human migration patterns from the past.
```

### DNA Structure
```
DNA is a polymer made from four different nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a common sugar and
phosphate group with one of four different bases attached to the sugar.

DNA contains four bases, A, C, G and T.

A sequence of three bases is the code for a particular amino acid. The
order of bases controls the order in which amino acids are assembled to
produce a particular protein.

The long strands of DNA consist of alternating sugar and phosphate
sections. Attached to each sugar is one of the four bases.

The DNA polymer is made up of repeating nucleotide units.
```

### Protein Synthesis
```
Proteins are synthesised on ribosomes, according to a template.
Carrier molecules bring specific amino acids to add to the growing protein chain in the correct order.
When the protein chain is complete it folds up to form a unique shape.
This unique shape enables the proteins to do their job as enzymes, hormones or forming structures in the body such as collagen.

A template is taken from the DNA and leaves the nucleus.
The template is used to guide protein synthesis on ribosomes located in the cytoplasm.
Specific amino acids are delivered by carrier molecules to the protein chain, where they are added in the order shown on the template.
Once complete, the long protein chain folds up, giving it a unique structure.
This unique structure is essential to the protein’s function, in the form of enzymes, hormones, or structural proteins (e.g. collagen).
```

### Inherited diseases
```
Polydactyly (having extra fingers or toes) is caused by a dominant allele
Cystic fibrosis (a disorder of cell membranes) is caused by a recessive allele
```

## Variation and Evolution

### Variation caused due to
```
• the genes they have inherited (genetic causes)
• the conditions in which they have developed (environmental causes)
• a combination of genes and the environment.
```

### Process of Selective Breeding
```
Selective breeding involves choosing parents with the desired characteristic from a mixed population.
They are bred together.
From the offspring those with the desired characteristic are bred together.
This continues over many generations until all the offspring show the desired characteristic.

The characteristic can be chosen for usefulness or appearance:

• Disease resistance in food crops.
• Animals which produce more meat or milk.
• Domestic dogs with a gentle nature.
• Large or unusual flowers.

Selective breeding can lead to ‘inbreeding’ where some breeds are
particularly prone to disease or inherited defects.
```

### Embryonic Screening

Advantages
```
It could prevent people from suffering from genetic disorders.
During IVF, most embryos are surplus to requirements anyway.
In this case, screening would merely ensure that the implanted embryos are healthy.
A reduction in disorders that need to be treated would save a significant amount of money in the long-term.
```

Disadvantages
```
There is potential that defining desirability of embryo based on their genetic make-up can promote discrimination.
If mismanaged, this technology could become a way for parents to select the most desirable embryo as their child-to-be.
In the short-term, screening is an expensive process.
The embryos that are not used are destroyed. This can be considered unethical or against religious views.
```

### Steps(Genetic Engineering)
```
• enzymes are used to isolate the required gene; this gene is inserted
into a vector, usually a bacterial plasmid or a virus
• the vector is used to insert the gene into the required cells
• genes are transferred to the cells of animals, plants or
microorganisms at an early stage in their development so that they
develop with desired characteristics.
```

### Cloning
```
Tissue culture: using small groups of cells from part of a plant to grow
identical new plants. This is important for preserving rare plant species
or commercially in nurseries.

Cuttings: an older, but simple, method used by gardeners to produce
many identical new plants from a parent plant.

Embryo transplants: splitting apart cells from a developing animal
embryo before they become specialised, then transplanting the identical
embryos into host mothers.

Adult cell cloning:
• The nucleus is removed from an unfertilised egg cell.
• The nucleus from an adult body cell, such as a skin cell, is inserted
into the egg cell.
• An electric shock stimulates the egg cell to divide to form an embryo.
• These embryo cells contain the same genetic information as the adult
skin cell.
• When the embryo has developed into a ball of cells, it is inserted into
the womb of an adult female to continue its development.
```

##  The development of understanding of genetics and evolution

### Theory of Evolution
```
• Individual organisms within a particular species show a wide range of
variation for a characteristic.
• Individuals with characteristics most suited to the environment are
more likely to survive to breed successfully.
• The characteristics that have enabled these individuals to survive are
then passed on to the next generation.
```

### Only gradually accepted because
```
• the theory challenged the idea that God made all the animals and
plants that live on Earth
• there was insufficient evidence at the time the theory was published
to convince many scientists
• the mechanism of inheritance and variation was not known until
50 years after the theory was published.
```

### Fossils may be formed
```
• from parts of organisms that have not decayed because one or more
of the conditions needed for decay are absent
• when parts of the organism are replaced by minerals as they decay
• as preserved traces of organisms, such as footprints, burrows and
rootlet traces.
```

Many early forms of life were soft-bodied, which means that they

have left few traces behind. What traces there were have been mainly

destroyed by geological activity. This is why scientists cannot be certain

about how life began on Earth.


### Steps(Speciation)
```
Population geographically isolated from each other
Environmental conditions are different for populations
Random genetic mutations cause variation in population
Individuals more likely to survive will be more likely to pass on genes
Overtime, each population have greater differences in genotype
Populations so genetically diff., cannot breed to produce fertile offspring
```

### Extinction reasons
```
New predator kills all
Environment changes
New disease kills all
Can't compete with other species for food
Natural disaster kills all
```

### Steps(Natural Selection)
```
Mutation causes variation in population
Advantage to survival, go on to reproduce
Alleles passed on to offspring
Repeated over many generations
```

### Steps(Bacterial Resistance)
```
Mutations of bacterial pathogens produce new strains. Some strains
might be resistant to antibiotics, and so are not killed. They survive and
reproduce, so the population of the resistant strain rises. The resistant
strain will then spread because people are not immune to it and there is
no effective treatment.
```

### Antibiotic resistant strains.(Rate of development)--
```
• doctors should not prescribe antibiotics inappropriately, such as
treating non-serious or viral infections
• patients should complete their course of antibiotics so all bacteria are
killed and none survive to mutate and form resistant strains
• the agricultural use of antibiotics should be restricted.
```

## Classification

Linnaeus classified living things into **kingdom, phylum, class, order,**

**family, genus and species**. Organisms are named by the binomial system

of genus and species.

---

As evidence of internal structures became more developed due to

improvements in microscopes, and the understanding of biochemical

processes progressed, new models of classification were proposed.

Due to evidence available from chemical analysis there is now a 3 domain system developed by Carl Woese. 

In this system organisms are divided into:

• archaea (primitive bacteria usually living in extreme environments)

• bacteria (true bacteria)

• eukaryota (which includes protists, fungi, plants and animals).

```
Evolutionary trees are a method used by scientists to show how they
believe organisms are related. They use current classification data for
living organisms and fossil data for extinct organisms.
```

# Topic 7 - Ecology
