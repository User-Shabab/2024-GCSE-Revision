## Nebula's journey to somethin
```
Nebula (dust particles attracted with gravity)
Cloud become hotter and denser till fusion start to occur
Grows to main sequence star and stay stable long as p.a from fusion balanced w/ grav. pull
When dies, outward p.a++ so expand to either RED GIANT (our sun size) // SUPER RED GIANT
RED GIANT turn to WHITE DAWRF when all fuel go out then Black dawrf when cooled
SUPER RED GIANT go explode to supernova leaving dense stuff called NEUTRON STAR or more dense stuff called BLACK HOLE
(SUPERNOVA BE MAKING HEAVY ELEMENTS AND NEW NEBULA TOO)
```

## Satellites
```
Geostationary satellites be oribittin in a circle aorund earth (above same point on equator)
Orbit circular so speed be constant but velocity be changing (coz direction be changin)
Hence accelerating but not getting any faster
Used for GPS, TV, & Comm.s

Centripetal force be actin to centre of orbit so velocity dir. be  tangent so these 2 perpendicular to each other

If satellite have eliptical orbit then it be gettin faster as gettin closer
Used for weather and recon.
```

## Red Shift & Big Bang Theory
```
Red shift - when wavelength of light from distant galaxies be stretched coz galaxies moving away from us
Doppler effect - apparent change in freq.//wavelength of a wave due to relative motion of source & observer
```
