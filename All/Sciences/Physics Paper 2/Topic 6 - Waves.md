# Topic 6 - Waves

## Transverse and Longitudinal
```
Transverse (NOT NEED MEDIUM): Direction of energy transfer is perpendicular to oscillations
Eg: Ripple waves, EM waves, S-waves

Longitudinal (NEEDS A MEDIUM): Direction of energy transfer is parallel to oscillations
Eg: Sound waves, P-waves
```

## Features of a wave
```
Amplitude
Frequency
Wavelength
Period

Period = 1 ÷ Frequency
v = fλ
```

## Sound & Seismic Waves

**KNOW HOW SONAR WORKS**

Human ear only hear **20Hz-20KHz**

P-waves pass thru all of Earth while S-waves can't pass thru liquid core

### Light rays
```
If light reflect off smooth thing it's "Specular reflection"
So angle of reflection be same as angle of incidence relative to the normal.
But if rough then "Diffuse reflection"
```

## EM Waves

```
RADIO
MICRO
INFRA-RED
VISIBLE LIGHT
ULTRA VIOLET
X-RAYS
GAMMA RAYS
```

### Uses
```
RADIO - Phones, TV, Wifi
MICRO - Cooking
INFRA-RED - Cooking
VISIBLE LIGHT - Vision
ULTRA VIOLET - Tanning
X-RAYS - Medical sacns
GAMMA RAYS - Sterilising, Medical treatments
```
