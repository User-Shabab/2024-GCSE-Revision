# Topic 5 - Forces

## Scalar and Vector Quantities
```
Scalar values only have magnitude
Eg:
Mass
Temperature
Speed
Energy

Vector quantities have magnitude and direction
Eg:
Displacement
Weight
Force
Velocity

A vector quantity may be represented by an arrow. The length of
the arrow represents the magnitude, and the direction of the arrow
the direction of the vector quantity
```

Forces are a push or pull acting on an object

Can be: Contact and Non-contact Forces

```
Contact Forces
Eg ( friction, air resistance, tension and normal contact force)
Non-contact Forces
Eg (gravitational force, electrostatic force and magnetic force)
```

Normal contact force only happen if 2 objects in direct contact

Weight is measured using a calibrated spring-balance (a newtonmeter).

## Resultant forces
```
A number of forces acting on an object may be replaced by a single
force that has the same effect as all the original forces acting
together. This single force is called the resultant force.

Use free body diagrams to describe qualitatively examples
where several forces lead to a resultant force on an object,
including balanced forces when the resultant force is zero.

## Values for speed
```
walking ̴ 1.5 m/s
running ̴ 3 m/s
cycling ̴ 6 m/s
sound in air is 330 m/s
```

## Equations

weight  = mass  × gravitational field strength

work done = force × distance

F = ke

F = pA

s = vt

a = (v - u) ÷ t

v<sup>2</sup> −  u<sup>2</sup> = 2as

F = ma

p = mv

M = Fd


## Pressure and pressure differences in fluids
```
A partially (or totally) submerged object experiences a greater
pressure on the bottom surface than on the top surface. This
creates a resultant force upwards. This force is called the upthrust.

Atmospheric pressure
The atmosphere is a thin layer (relative to the size of the Earth) of
air round the Earth. The atmosphere gets less dense with
increasing altitude.
Air molecules colliding with a surface create atmospheric pressure.
The number of air molecules (and so the weight of air) above a
surface decreases as the height of the surface above ground level
increases. So as height increases there is always less air above a
surface than there is at a lower height. So atmospheric pressure
decreases with an increase in height.
