# Topic 6 - The Rate and Extent of Chemical Change

## Calculate rate of reaciton
```
Mean rate of reaction = Quantity of product formed ÷ Time taken
```



# Topic 7 - Organic Chemistry

## Hydrocarbons

Longer chains of hydrocarbons have:
- [ ] Higher Viscosity
- [ ] Lower Flammability
- [ ] Higher boiling points

Meth_ == 1 Carbons

Eth_ == 2 Carbons

Prop_ == 3 Carbons

But_ == 4 Carbons

Pent_ == 5 Carbons

Complete combustion
```
Hydrocarbon + Oxygen → Water + Carbon Dioxide
```

Can do incomplete combustion (add on carbon and carbon monoxide on products side)

### Alkanes

General formula: C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>

Saturated since all hydrogens bond with carbons

NO CHANGE TO BROMINE WATER

### Alkenes

General formula: C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>

Unsaturated since double bond restricts hydrogen numbers

TURN BROMINE WATER COLORLESS

CAN BE COMBINED TO MAKE POLYMERS

REACTIONS
```
(With phosphoric catalyst, 300°C)
Alkene + Steam → Alcohol (HYDRATION)

WILL GIVE SMOKY FLAME IN INCOMPLETE COMBUSTION

(With nickel catalyst, 60°C)
Alkene + Hydrogen → Alkane (HYDROGENATION)
```

### Fractional Distillation (Crude Oils)
```
Evaporation
Condensation
Collection
```

### Cracking (Crude Oils)
```
Steam cracking {
  Heat to very high temperature} 800°C}
Catalytic cracking {
  Heat 550°C
  Pass over powdered aluminum oxide catalyst}
```

## Alocohols

General formula: C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+1</sub>OH

Add on a CH<sub>2</sub> as it increases

### Reactions

Alcohols reacting with oxidising agent produce a carboxylic acid

Alcohols with sodium produce hydrogen

Alcohols with water produce neutral solutions

Alcohols with air and heat produce carbon dioxide and water

### Fermentation
Conditions:
```
A temperature of 25-35°C
A solution that is slightly acidic
In the absence of oxygen (anaerobic)
```

### Uses
```
Methanol: Chemical feedstock, Industrial ethanol
Ethanol: Alcohol, Fuel to burn, Solvent
Propanol: Fuel to burn, Solvent
Butanol: Fuel to burn, Solvent
```

## Carboxylic Acids

PARTIALLY IONISE IN WATER SINCE A WEAK ACID

General formula: C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+1</sub>COOH.

Add on a CH<sub>2</sub> as it increases

### Reactions
```
(With sulfuric catalyst)
Ethanoic acid + ethanol → ethyl ethanoate + water

REACTING WITH WATER PRODUCES:
A salt
Carbon dioxide
Water

When carboxylic acids react with water, they dissolve to give solutions with an acidic pH.
```

## All Reactions
```
Hydrocarbon + Oxygen → Water + Carbon Dioxide
Alkene + Oxygen → Carbon + Carbon Monoxide + Carbon Dioxide + Water
Alkenes + Steam ⇌ Alcohols (Hydration)
Alkenes + Hydrogen → Alkane (Hydrogenation)
Acid + Metal Carbonate → Metal Salt + Carbon Dioxide + Water
Alcohol + Carboxylic Acid ⇌ Ester + Water + Carbon Dioxide
Glucose → Ethanol + Carbon Dioxide (Fermentation)
```
## Polymers

### Addition polymerisation
```
In addition polymerisation reactions, many small molecules
(monomers) join together to form very large molecules (polymers).
For example:
In addition polymers the repeating unit has the same atoms as the
monomer because no other molecule is formed in the reaction.

Functional group C=C in the monomers
```

### Condensation polymerisation
```
Involves monomers with two functional groups. When these types of monomers react they join
together, usually losing small molecules such as water, and so the
reactions are called condensation reactions.
```

### Amino acids
```
Amino acids have two different functional groups in a molecule.
Amino acids react by condensation polymerisation to produce
polypeptides
```
