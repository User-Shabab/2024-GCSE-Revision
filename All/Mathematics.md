# Proving the Quadratic Formula

Start with the general equation of ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0

**ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0**

**x<sup>2</sup> + <sup>b</sup>⁄<sub>a</sub>x + <sup>c</sup>⁄<sub>a</sub> = 0**

**x<sup>2</sup> + <sup>b</sup>⁄<sub>a</sub>x = -<sup>c</sup>⁄<sub>a</sub>**

**(x + <sup>b</sup>⁄<sub>2a</sub>)<sup>2</sup> - (<sup>b</sup>⁄<sub>2a</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = -<sup>c</sup>⁄<sub>a</sub>**

# Quadratics

Quadratic equations can be solved in 3 ways.

# Simultaneous Equations

Solved in 2 ways.

## Method 1) Elimination

4x + 3y = 18

 x - 3y = 7

Adding both equations together to eliminate y we get:

5x     = 25

∴ x = 5

So x is subsituted in any other equation to find y

(5) - 3y = 7

(5) - 7 = 3y

<sup>-2</sup> / <sub>3</sub> = y

∴ y = -2/3



## Method 2) Subsitution

2x + 3y =  9.95

 x + 4y = 10.35
 
So we rearrange one of them to subsitute into the other:

2x + 3y =  9.95

 x = 10.35 - 4y

So now subsitute second equation into first one:

≡ 2(10.35 - 4y) + 3y = 9.95

20.70 - 8y + 3y = 9.95

20.70 - 5y = 9.95

20.70 = 9.95 + 5y

20.70 - 9.95 = 5y

10.75 = 5y

∴ y = 2.15

Now we subsitute this into any equation to find x

x + 4(2.15) = 10.35

x = 10.35 - 4(2.15)

∴ x = 1.75
