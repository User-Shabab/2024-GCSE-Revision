# Topic 5 - Homeostasis and Response

## Nervous vs Endocrine System

### Central nervous system (CNS)
```
Triggers rapid response.
Uses electrical signals that are carried by neurones.
Response is very short.
Acts on a very precise part of the body.
```

### Endocrine (hormonal) system
```
Triggers a slower response.
Uses chemical messengers that are carried by blood.
Response can be long-lasting.
Can act on large areas of the body.
```

## The Nervous System

### Reflex Arc
```
A stimulus is detected by a receptor
Impulses or electrical signals sent along sensory neurone
Impulses passed along via relay neurone
Impulses travel along motor neurone
Impulse reaches effector where muscle or gland used
```

### Entities
```
CNS: Receives info from receptors and coordinates a response
Synapses: Connection between 2 neurones, using chemical diffusion
Sensory neurones: Carry info from receptors to CNS
Motor neurones: Carry info from CNS to effectors
Effectors: Glands and Muscles that carry out an action
Receptor: Detects change in environment
```

Regulating internal conditions
```
Carbon dioxide levels
Urea concentration (in urine)
Internal body temperature
Blood sugar levels
Water levels
```

Negative feedback
```
When our internal conditions are optimal, the body does not need to respond.
If an internal condition changes and is no longer optimal, this stimulus is detected and the body works to counteract (reverse) the change and return conditions to the optimum.
This process is called negative feedback and needs all of the components of the nervous system to work together.
```

## The Brain

### 3 Main parts

#### Cerebral cortex
```
This part is responsible for conscious thought (e.g. memory, language and intelligence).
```

#### Cerebellum
```
This part is responsible for the muscle coordination.
The cerebellum is important for movement, posture, balance and speech.
```

#### Medulla
```
This part is responsible for unconscious activities (e.g. breathing and heartbeat).
```



## The Eye

### Parts of the eye

#### Retina
```
Packed with receptor cells, which are sensitive to both the brightness (light intensity) and the colour of light
```

#### Iris
```
Controls pupil diameter and the quantity of light reaching the retina
```

#### Pupil
```
A hole in the centre of the iris, through which light passes
```

#### Suspensory ligaments
```
A ring of fibres that connect ciliary muscles to the lens
```

#### Ciliary muscles
```
A ring of smooth muscle that changes the shape of the lens to focus light
```

#### Optic nerve
```
Transmits visual information, in the form of electrical impulses, from the retina to the brain
```

#### Sclera
```
The white of the eye; the opaque protective outer layer
```

#### Cornea
```
The transparent frontal portion of the eye responsible for refracting light
```

## Controlling Body Temperature

### Thermoregulation

#### Too cold
```
Muscle contractions increase, causing shivering.
Hairs stand on end.
Blood vessels constrict to reduce blood flow in capillaries (vasoconstriction). {
  If we are too cold, then the muscular walls contract.
  This is called vasoconstriction.
  This reduces the blood flow to the skin surface and heat energy is kept inside the body. }
```

#### Too hot
```
Sweat is released from sweat glands under the skin.
Hairs lie flat.
Blood vessels dilate to allow more blood to enter capillaries that pass close to the skin surface (vasodilation). {
  If we are too hot, then the muscular walls relax.
  This is called vasodilation.
  This allows more blood to enter and flow through capillaries close to the skin surface. The excess heat energy is transferred to the surroundings. }
```

### Sweating and Shivering

#### Sweating
```
Sweat glands release water, which covers the skin.
Heat energy from the body is transferred to this water and, when it has enough energy, it evaporates.
As it evaporates, it takes the heat energy with it. This lowers the average temperature of the body.
```

#### Shivering
```
When we are too cold, muscles start to contract automatically. This makes us shiver.
This process requires energy, which is generated through respiration.
Respiration produces heat, which warms us up.
```

### Body Hairs

#### Too cold
```
When we are too cold, the hair erector muscle contracts, causing the hair to stand on end (which pull on the skin giving you goosebumps).
When all the hairs are standing on end, they trap an insulating layer of air around the body.
```

#### Too hot
```
When we are too hot, the hair erector muscle relaxes, causing the hair to lie flat.
```

## The Endocrine System

### Testes (male only)
```
The testes produce testosterone, which controls puberty and sperm production.
```

### Adrenal glands
```
The two adrenal glands are situated above each kidney.
They produce adrenaline, which triggers the ‘fight or flight’ response when an organism is presented with a dangerous situation.
```

### Thyroid gland
```
This gland is in our neck and releases thyroxine.
Thyroxine regulates our metabolism, heart rate and temperature.
```

### Pancreas
```
The pancreas produces insulin and glucagon, both of which are involved in regulating blood glucose levels.
```

### Pituitary gland
```
This is the main endocrine gland or "master gland".
It is found in the brain and is linked to the hypothalamus (part of the brain that receives signals from receptors).
The pituitary gland releases hormones in response to changes detected by the hypothalamus.
Lots of these hormones trigger other glands to release more hormones.
```

### Ovaries (female only)
```
The ovaries produce oestrogen, which controls puberty and is one of the main hormones in the regulation of the menstrual cycle.
```

## Controlling Blood Glucose

If blood glucose levels are too high, this can have a negative impact on osmosis (movement of water between cells) by affecting concentration gradients.

Glucose is important for respiration.
Respiration releases the energy needed by every living cell.

If there is not enough glucose, an organism cannot produce enough energy.

### Diabetes

Type 1 diabetes
In type 1 diabetes, sufferers are unable to produce enough insulin.
The main treatment is to inject insulin when blood glucose levels rise too high.
Sufferers can also manage their diet and exercise regularly to keep blood glucose levels as steady as possible.

Type 2 diabetes
In type 2 diabetes, sufferers can still produce insulin, but their body no longer responds to it.
Because the body no longer responds to insulin, injecting insulin will not help.
Instead, sufferers must manage their diet and exercise regularly to keep blood glucose levels steady.

## The Kidneys

## Kidney Failure

## Menstrual Cycle

## Controlling Fertility

## Thyroxine

Thyroxine is responsible for regulating the growth and brain development of young animals.

Production is regulated by a negative feedback loop. This allows the body to maintain a fairly constant concentration of thyroxine in the blood.
When the concentration of thyroid hormones, such as thyroxine, in the blood is low, the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is increased.
This stimulates the secretion of thyroxine by the thyroid gland.
When the concentration of thyroid hormones in the blood is high, TSH production is decreased.

### Adrenaline

Adrenaline increases heart rate and blood pressure, and dilates the pupils in our eyes.
Adrenaline enlarges the air passages of the lungs and alters metabolism in order to boost the delivery of oxygen and glucose to the brain and the muscles.
In times of fear or stress, adrenaline is part of the so-called ‘fight or flight’ response, preparing the body to move and think quickly in response to danger.

## Plant Hormones

### Commercial Uses

# Topic 6 - Inheritence, Variation, and Evolution

## Reproduction

### Advantages of Reproduction
```
Advantages of sexual reproduction:
• produces variation in the offspring
• if the environment changes variation gives a survival advantage by natural
selection
• natural selection can be speeded up by humans in selective breeding to
increase food production.

Advantages of asexual reproduction:
• only one parent needed
• more time and energy efficient as do not need to find a mate
• faster than sexual reproduction
• many identical offspring can be produced when conditions are favourable.
```

### Organisms
```
• Malarial parasites reproduce asexually in the human host, but sexually in
the mosquito.
• Many fungi reproduce asexually by spores but also reproduce sexually to
give variation.
• Many plants produce seeds sexually, but also reproduce asexually by
runners such as strawberry plants, or bulb division such as daffodils
```

## DNA and Genome

### Importance of studying human genome
```
• search for genes linked to different types of disease
• understanding and treatment of inherited disorders
• use in tracing human migration patterns from the past.
```

### DNA Structure
```
DNA is a polymer made from four different nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a common sugar and
phosphate group with one of four different bases attached to the sugar.

DNA contains four bases, A, C, G and T.

A sequence of three bases is the code for a particular amino acid. The
order of bases controls the order in which amino acids are assembled to
produce a particular protein.

The long strands of DNA consist of alternating sugar and phosphate
sections. Attached to each sugar is one of the four bases.

The DNA polymer is made up of repeating nucleotide units.
```

### Protein Synthesis
```
Proteins are synthesised on ribosomes, according to a template.
Carrier molecules bring specific amino acids to add to the growing protein chain in the correct order.
When the protein chain is complete it folds up to form a unique shape.
This unique shape enables the proteins to do their job as enzymes, hormones or forming structures in the body such as collagen.

A template is taken from the DNA and leaves the nucleus.
The template is used to guide protein synthesis on ribosomes located in the cytoplasm.
Specific amino acids are delivered by carrier molecules to the protein chain, where they are added in the order shown on the template.
Once complete, the long protein chain folds up, giving it a unique structure.
This unique structure is essential to the protein’s function, in the form of enzymes, hormones, or structural proteins (e.g. collagen).
```

### Inherited diseases
```
Polydactyly (having extra fingers or toes) is caused by a dominant allele
Cystic fibrosis (a disorder of cell membranes) is caused by a recessive allele
```

## Variation and Evolution

### Variation caused due to
```
• the genes they have inherited (genetic causes)
• the conditions in which they have developed (environmental causes)
• a combination of genes and the environment.
```

### Process of Selective Breeding
```
Selective breeding involves choosing parents with the desired characteristic from a mixed population.
They are bred together.
From the offspring those with the desired characteristic are bred together.
This continues over many generations until all the offspring show the desired characteristic.

The characteristic can be chosen for usefulness or appearance:

• Disease resistance in food crops.
• Animals which produce more meat or milk.
• Domestic dogs with a gentle nature.
• Large or unusual flowers.

Selective breeding can lead to ‘inbreeding’ where some breeds are
particularly prone to disease or inherited defects.
```

### Steps(Genetic Engineering)
```
• enzymes are used to isolate the required gene; this gene is inserted
into a vector, usually a bacterial plasmid or a virus
• the vector is used to insert the gene into the required cells
• genes are transferred to the cells of animals, plants or
microorganisms at an early stage in their development so that they
develop with desired characteristics.
```

### Cloning
```
Tissue culture: using small groups of cells from part of a plant to grow
identical new plants. This is important for preserving rare plant species
or commercially in nurseries.

Cuttings: an older, but simple, method used by gardeners to produce
many identical new plants from a parent plant.

Embryo transplants: splitting apart cells from a developing animal
embryo before they become specialised, then transplanting the identical
embryos into host mothers.

Adult cell cloning:
• The nucleus is removed from an unfertilised egg cell.
• The nucleus from an adult body cell, such as a skin cell, is inserted
into the egg cell.
• An electric shock stimulates the egg cell to divide to form an embryo.
• These embryo cells contain the same genetic information as the adult
skin cell.
• When the embryo has developed into a ball of cells, it is inserted into
the womb of an adult female to continue its development.
```

##  The development of understanding of genetics and evolution

### Theory of Evolution
```
• Individual organisms within a particular species show a wide range of
variation for a characteristic.
• Individuals with characteristics most suited to the environment are
more likely to survive to breed successfully.
• The characteristics that have enabled these individuals to survive are
then passed on to the next generation.
```

### Only gradually accepted because
```
• the theory challenged the idea that God made all the animals and
plants that live on Earth
• there was insufficient evidence at the time the theory was published
to convince many scientists
• the mechanism of inheritance and variation was not known until
50 years after the theory was published.
```

### Fossils may be formed
```
• from parts of organisms that have not decayed because one or more
of the conditions needed for decay are absent
• when parts of the organism are replaced by minerals as they decay
• as preserved traces of organisms, such as footprints, burrows and
rootlet traces.
```

Many early forms of life were soft-bodied, which means that they

have left few traces behind. What traces there were have been mainly

destroyed by geological activity. This is why scientists cannot be certain

about how life began on Earth.


### Steps(Speciation)
```
Population geographically isolated from each other
Environmental conditions are different for populations
Random genetic mutations cause variation in population
Individuals more likely to survive will be more likely to pass on genes
Overtime, each population have greater differences in genotype
Populations so genetically diff., cannot breed to produce fertile offspring
```

### Extinction reasons
```
New predator kills all
Environment changes
New disease kills all
Can't compete with other species for food
Natural disaster kills all
```

### Steps(Natural Selection)
```
Mutation causes variation in population
Advantage to survival, go on to reproduce
Alleles passed on to offspring
Repeated over many generations
```

### Steps(Bacterial Resistance)
```
Mutations of bacterial pathogens produce new strains. Some strains
might be resistant to antibiotics, and so are not killed. They survive and
reproduce, so the population of the resistant strain rises. The resistant
strain will then spread because people are not immune to it and there is
no effective treatment.
```

### Antibiotic resistant strains.(Rate of development)--
```
• doctors should not prescribe antibiotics inappropriately, such as
treating non-serious or viral infections
• patients should complete their course of antibiotics so all bacteria are
killed and none survive to mutate and form resistant strains
• the agricultural use of antibiotics should be restricted.
```

## Classification

Linnaeus classified living things into **kingdom, phylum, class, order,**

**family, genus and species**. Organisms are named by the binomial system

of genus and species.

---

As evidence of internal structures became more developed due to

improvements in microscopes, and the understanding of biochemical

processes progressed, new models of classification were proposed.

Due to evidence available from chemical analysis there is now a 3 domain system developed by Carl Woese. 

In this system organisms are divided into:

• archaea (primitive bacteria usually living in extreme environments)

• bacteria (true bacteria)

• eukaryota (which includes protists, fungi, plants and animals).

```
Evolutionary trees are a method used by scientists to show how they
believe organisms are related. They use current classification data for
living organisms and fossil data for extinct organisms.
```
