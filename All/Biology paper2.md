# Topic 5 - Homeostasis and Response

## The Nervous System

### Reflex Arc
```
A stimulus is detected by a receptor
Impulses or electrical signals sent along sensory neurone
Impulses passed along via relay neurone
Impulses travel along motor neurone
Impulse reaches effector where muscle or gland used
```

### Entities
```
CNS: Receives info from receptors and coordinates a response
Synapses: Connection between 2 neurones, using chemical diffusion
Sensory neurones: Carry info from receptors to CNS
Motor neurones: Carry info from CNS to effectors
Effectors: Glands and Muscles that carry out an action
Receptor: Detects change in environment
