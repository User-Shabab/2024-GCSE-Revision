## The Nervous System

### Reflex Arc
```
A stimulus is detected by a receptor
Impulses or electrical signals sent along sensory neurone
Impulses passed along via relay neurone
Impulses travel along motor neurone
Impulse reaches effector where muscle or gland used
```

### Entities
```
CNS: Receives info from receptors and coordinates a response
Synapses: Connection between 2 neurones, using chemical diffusion
Sensory neurones: Carry info from receptors to CNS
Motor neurones: Carry info from CNS to effectors
Effectors: Glands and Muscles that carry out an action
Receptor: Detects change in environment

## Reproduction

### Advantages of Reproduction
```
Advantages of sexual reproduction:
• produces variation in the offspring
• if the environment changes variation gives a survival advantage by natural
selection
• natural selection can be speeded up by humans in selective breeding to
increase food production.

Advantages of asexual reproduction:
• only one parent needed
• more time and energy efficient as do not need to find a mate
• faster than sexual reproduction
• many identical offspring can be produced when conditions are favourable.
```

### Organisms
```
• Malarial parasites reproduce asexually in the human host, but sexually in
the mosquito.
• Many fungi reproduce asexually by spores but also reproduce sexually to
give variation.
• Many plants produce seeds sexually, but also reproduce asexually by
runners such as strawberry plants, or bulb division such as daffodils
```

## DNA and Genome

### Importance of studying human genome
```
• search for genes linked to different types of disease
• understanding and treatment of inherited disorders
• use in tracing human migration patterns from the past.
```

### DNA Structure
```
DNA is a polymer made from four different nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a common sugar and
phosphate group with one of four different bases attached to the sugar.

DNA contains four bases, A, C, G and T.

A sequence of three bases is the code for a particular amino acid. The
order of bases controls the order in which amino acids are assembled to
produce a particular protein.

The long strands of DNA consist of alternating sugar and phosphate
sections. Attached to each sugar is one of the four bases.

The DNA polymer is made up of repeating nucleotide units.
```

### Protein Synthesis
```
Proteins are synthesised on ribosomes, according to a template.
Carrier molecules bring specific amino acids to add to the growing protein chain in the correct order.
When the protein chain is complete it folds up to form a unique shape.
This unique shape enables the proteins to do their job as enzymes, hormones or forming structures in the body such as collagen.
```

### Inherited diseases
```
Polydactyly (having extra fingers or toes) is caused by a dominant allele
Cystic fibrosis (a disorder of cell membranes) is caused by a recessive allele
```
