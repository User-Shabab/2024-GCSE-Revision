# Topic 5 - Homeostasis and Response

## The Nervous System

### Reflex Arc
```
A stimulus is detected by a receptor
Impulses or electrical signals sent along sensory neurone
Impulses passed along via relay neurone
Impulses travel along motor neurone
Impulse reaches effector where muscle or gland used
```

### Entities
```
CNS: Receives info from receptors and coordinates a response
Synapses: Connection between 2 neurones, using chemical diffusion
Sensory neurones: Carry info from receptors to CNS
Motor neurones: Carry info from CNS to effectors
Effectors: Glands and Muscles that carry out an action
Receptor: Detects change in environment

# Topic 6 - Inheritence, Variation, and Evolution

Importance of 
```
• search for genes linked to different types of disease
• understanding and treatment of inherited disorders
• use in tracing human migration patterns from the past.
```

Reproduction
```
Advantages of sexual reproduction:
• produces variation in the offspring
• if the environment changes variation gives a survival advantage by natural
selection
• natural selection can be speeded up by humans in selective breeding to
increase food production.

Advantages of asexual reproduction:
• only one parent needed
• more time and energy efficient as do not need to find a mate
• faster than sexual reproduction
• many identical offspring can be produced when conditions are favourable.
