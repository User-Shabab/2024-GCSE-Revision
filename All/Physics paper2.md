# Topic 5 - Forces

## Scalar and Vector Quantities
```
Scalar values only have magnitude
Eg:
Mass
Temperature
Speed
Energy

Vector quantities have magnitude and direction
Eg:
Displacement
Weight
Force
Velocity
```

Forces are a push or pull

Can be: Contact and Non-contact Forces

Normal contact force only happen if 2 objects in direct contact

## Equations
```
weight  = mass  × gravitational field strength
work done = force × distance
F = ke
F = pA
s = vt
a = (v - u) ÷ t
F = ma
p = mv
```

# Topic 6 - Waves

## Transverse and Longitudinal
```
Transverse (NOT NEED MEDIUM): Direction of energy transfer is parallel to oscillations
Eg: Ripple waves

Longitudinal (NEEDS A MEDIUM): Direction of energy transfer is perpendicular to oscillations
Eg: Sound waves
```

## Features of a wave
```
Amplitude
Frequency
Wavelength
Period

Period = 1 ÷ Frequency
v = fλ
```
