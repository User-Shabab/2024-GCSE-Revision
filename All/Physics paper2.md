## Transverse and Longitudinal
```
Transverse (NOT NEED MEDIUM): Direction of energy transfer is parallel to oscillations
Eg: Ripple waves

Longitudinal (NEEDS A MEDIUM): Direction of energy transfer is perpendicular to oscillations
Eg: Sound waves
```

## Features of a wave
```
Amplitude
Frequency
Wavelength
Period

Period = 1 ÷ Frequency
v = fλ
