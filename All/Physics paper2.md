# Topic 5 - Forces

## Scalar and Vector Quantities
```
Scalar values only have magnitude
Eg:
Mass
Temperature
Speed
Energy

Vector quantities have magnitude and direction
Eg:
Displacement
Weight
Force
Velocity

A vector quantity may be represented by an arrow. The length of
the arrow represents the magnitude, and the direction of the arrow
the direction of the vector quantity
```

Forces are a push or pull acting on an object

Can be: Contact and Non-contact Forces

```
Contact Forces
Eg ( friction, air resistance, tension and normal contact force)
Non-contact Forces
Eg (gravitational force, electrostatic force and magnetic force)
```

Normal contact force only happen if 2 objects in direct contact

## Equations
```
weight  = mass  × gravitational field strength
work done = force × distance
F = ke
F = pA
s = vt
a = (v - u) ÷ t
F = ma
p = mv
```

# Topic 6 - Waves

## Transverse and Longitudinal
```
Transverse (NOT NEED MEDIUM): Direction of energy transfer is parallel to oscillations
Eg: Ripple waves

Longitudinal (NEEDS A MEDIUM): Direction of energy transfer is perpendicular to oscillations
Eg: Sound waves
```

## Features of a wave
```
Amplitude
Frequency
Wavelength
Period

Period = 1 ÷ Frequency
v = fλ
```
