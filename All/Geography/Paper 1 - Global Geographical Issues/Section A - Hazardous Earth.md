## Section A - Hazardous Earth

### Atmospheric Cells
```
Hadley: Equator, Air rises
Ferrel: 30-60 degrees N & S
Polar: 60-90 degrees N & S

Air.fall == pressure++, rain--
Air.rise == pressure--, rain++
```

### Climate Change

#### Causes
```
Natural {
  Milankovitch cycles
  Volcanic Activity
  Surface Impacts
  Sunspot Activity }

Human {
  Deforestation
  Agriculture
  Burning fossil fuels }
```

#### Evidence
```
Natural {
  Tree rings
  Ice cores
  Historical sources }

Human {
  Sea level rise
  Increase in air temperature
  Melting ice sheets }
```

### Tropical Cyclones

#### Conditions and Location
```
Water temperatures above 26.5°C
Form around the ITCZ
Coriolis force provides the cyclone with the spin
```

### Case Studies

#### Developing Country: The Philippines

Tropical Cyclones

**November 2013**

```
Preparation {
  Japan helped to track the typhoon
  750,000 residents were evacuated 2 days before the typhoon hit
  The USA sent their military to help prepare the country
  Emergency shelters were not high enough to escape flooding }

Responses {
  7 regions were placed under a ‘State of National Calamity’
  Roads were blocked and damage to airports slowed relief efforts
  The UK provided medicine for 800,000 people
  The United Nations sent £480 million }
```

#### Developed Country: The USA

Tropical Cyclones

**August 2005**

```
Preparation {
  Forecasting and tracking was very good
  80% of New Orleans were evacuated
  The Superdome stadium was used as emergency shelter
  Flood defences did not work and 80% of New Orleans was flooded }

Responses {
  $14 billion was spent on improving flood defences
  FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) helped rehome 700,000 families
  The emergency services were slow and unprepared
  The UK government sent food aid }
```
