### Biome comparisons
```
Taiga = cold and dry
Rainforest = hot and wet

Taiga = Litter is the largest nutrient store
Rainforest = biomass is the largest nutrient store

Taiga = thick fur
Rainforest = prehensile tail

Taiga = cone shaped trees
Rainforest = drip tips
```

### 4 Markers 'Explain' questions

#### "How the interdependence of abiotic and biotic components leads to low productivity in the Taiga biome"
```
METHOD 1:
An abiotic component in the Taiga is the
climate. Colder temperatures and low
rainfall means that decomposition of
litter is slow (1). This leads to a large
store of nutrients retained in the litter,
and less in the soil which results in less
plant growth (1).

A biotic component in the Taiga is the
flora (plants). Only a few species of
plants can survive in the Taiga (1)
because of extreme low temperatures
and low levels of sunlight (1).

METHOD 2:
One reason why the Taiga forest
has low productivity is the
climate is very cold (1). This
means that decomposition of
litter is very slow, so more
nutrients are stored in the litter
on the forest floor (1).

Another reason is because there
are low sunlight levels in the
Taiga (1). This means that
biodiversity is low as plants find
it difficult to grow in harsh
conditions (1).
