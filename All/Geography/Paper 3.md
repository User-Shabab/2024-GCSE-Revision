## People and the Biosphere

## Forests under threat

### Biome comparisons
```
Taiga = cold and dry
Rainforest = hot and wet

Taiga = Litter is the largest nutrient store
Rainforest = biomass is the largest nutrient store

Taiga = thick fur
Rainforest = prehensile tail

Taiga = cone shaped trees
Rainforest = drip tips
```

### 4 Markers 'Explain' questions

#### "How the interdependence of abiotic and biotic components leads to low productivity in the Taiga biome"
```
METHOD 1:
An abiotic component in the Taiga is the
climate. Colder temperatures and low
rainfall means that decomposition of
litter is slow (1). This leads to a large
store of nutrients retained in the litter,
and less in the soil which results in less
plant growth (1).

A biotic component in the Taiga is the
flora (plants). Only a few species of
plants can survive in the Taiga (1)
because of extreme low temperatures
and low levels of sunlight (1).

METHOD 2:
One reason why the Taiga forest
has low productivity is the
climate is very cold (1). This
means that decomposition of
litter is very slow, so more
nutrients are stored in the litter
on the forest floor (1).

Another reason is because there
are low sunlight levels in the
Taiga (1). This means that
biodiversity is low as plants find
it difficult to grow in harsh
conditions (1).

```
> Paragraph 1: B for BELIEVE

Support the option you chose

Point) Why it's good
Evidence) Evidences from anything
Explain) How that can help the situation
Evaluate/Analyse) This is significant because...
Link) Hence best option to go for

> Paragraph 2: R for REJECT

Outline some things on why it can be bad
Ultiamately end with saying how it's still worth it

Point) Why it's bad
Evidence) Evidences from anthing
Explain) How this can be hamful
Evaluate/Analyse) Ensure this analysis is supportive of option
Link) Overall it's worth troubles since long-term benefits much worth it

> Paragraph 3: A for AGAINST AND AGAINST

Go full on against why the other options are bad, no mercy

Points) These options are not the best plans
Evidences) Pick evidence against the situation but supporting these options
Explanations) How will this bring harm mainly and no benefit?
Evaluations/Analyses) And that's terrible because it's not long-term/beneficial
Links) So these options aren't worth it

> Paragraph 4: W for WAFFLE and L for LINK

Summarise your arguments on why you're right and other options wrong
End by stating your option is the correct answer

1) Your option is best because...
2) The other option is not ideal because...
3) And the other option is not ideal because...
4) Overall, my option is best long term to help...{repeat question}
