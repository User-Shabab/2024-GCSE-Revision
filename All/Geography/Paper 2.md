## Processes of Erosion
```
Hydraulic Action- water pushes into cracks in rocks
Attrition- rocks hit against each other
Abrasion – rocks rub/scrape against cliffs
Solution – weakly acidic sea water dissolves rocks
```

## Processes of Transportation
```
Traction – rocks roll along the sea floor
Saltation – rocks bounce along the sea floor
Suspension – rocks are held up and carried in waves
Solution – sediment is dissolved and carried in the waves
```

## Processes of Deposition
```
Deposition – occurs when waves lose energy (wind speed drops)
and drop sediment they are carrying
```

## Landforms

### Coasts

#### Erosional
```
Cave, arch, stack, stump
1. Waves erode cracks in a headland by hydraulic
action- the force of the waves pushes into the
cracks, widening them, forming caves.
2. Erosion of the back of the cave by abrasion will
cause it to break through to the other side of the
headland forming an arch.
3. The top of the arch is weakened by further erosion
and weathering. It becomes unstable and collapses
leaving behind a pillar of rock called a stack.
4. Erosion of the base of the stack will cause it to fall
over forming a stump.

Wave-cut platform and cliffs
1. At high tide, waves will erode the bottom of a cliff
by hydraulic action- when the force of the waves
pushes into cracks in the cliff, widening them.
2. Over time this forms a wave-cut notch at the base
of the cliff- like an ice-cream scoop along the
bottom of the cliff.
3. This undercuts the cliff above, which will become
unstable as the wave-cut notch gets bigger. The cliff
will eventually collapse.
4. This process repeats over time, leaving behind a
rocky platform that is exposed at low tide called a
wave-cut platform, with a steep cliff behind it.

Headlands and bays
1. Headlands and bays form on discordant coastlines
where there are alternating bands of hard and soft
rock arranges perpendicular (at right angles) to the
coastline.
2. The bands of softer rock are less resistant, so they
erode faster due to processes like abrasion, when
rocks rub against the cliffs wearing them away like
sandpaper.
3. The erosion of the softer rock forms bays, which are
sheltered areas of the coast where beaches form.
4. The harder bands of rock are more resistant to
erosion so they erode slowly, and are left sticking
out to sea forming headlands.

Beach
1. Beaches form due to transportation and deposition
in sheltered areas of the coastlines like bays.
2. Wind speed is lower in bays, therefore waves have
low energy, and are usually constructive waves.
3. Constructive waves have a weak backwash and a
strong swash, which means that sediment carried
in the waves by suspension (when sediment is held
up and carried in waves) can be deposited as the
swash moves towards the coast.
4. Sediment and sand is deposited on the coastline,
over time building up to form a beach.

Spit
1. A spit begins to form when longshore drift
transports sediment along the coastline. The wind
pushes the swash of a wave up the beach at an
angle, and the backwash moves straight back out to
sea due to gravity.
2. This process repeats and sediment is transported
along the coast in a zig-zag pattern.
3. When longshore drift reaches a bend in the
coastline, wind speed drops and the waves lose
energy. This cause deposition of sediment to occur.
4. Over time, more sediment is transported and
deposited which results in the formation of a long
ridge of sand sticking out to sea called a spit.

Bar
1. A bar begins to form when longshore drift
transports sediment along the coastline. The wind
pushes the swash of a wave up the beach at an
angle, and the backwash moves straight back out to
sea due to gravity.
2. This process repeats and sediment is transported
along the coast in a zig-zag pattern.
3. When longshore drift reaches a bend in the
coastline, wind speed drops and the waves lose
energy. This cause deposition of sediment to occur.
4. As more sediment is deposited, a spit forms. If the
spit connects to another headland this forms a bar,
with a lagoon of trapped water behind it.

### Rivers

#### Erosional
```
V-shaped valley
1. In the upper course of a river, water flows down
steep hills in mountainous areas resulting in vertical erosion.
2. The river erodes a deep notch down into the
landscape using hydraulic action, when the force of
the moving water pushes into cracks and forces
them open wider.
3. As the river erodes downwards the sides of the
valley are exposed to freeze-thaw weathering
which is when water freezes in cracks, expands, and
breaks down the rocks.
4. Loose rocks from the sides of the valley will fall into
the river. The vertical erosion and weathering of the
sides of the valley continue until a steep sided V-
shaped valley is formed.

Waterfalls and gorges
1. A waterfall forms in the upper course when a river
flows over layers of hard and soft rock.
2. The soft rock is eroded faster because it is less
resistant to erosion. The river erodes the soft rock
by hydraulic action- when the force of moving
water pushes into cracks in the soft rock, widening
them and causing parts to break away.
3. The river undercuts the harder rock leaving behind
an overhang of hard rock at the top of the waterfall,
and a deep plunge pool below.
4. The overhang will become unstable and collapse
into the plunge pool, causing further erosion by
abrasion and attrition. This process will repeat until
a steep sided gorge is formed.

Interlocking Spurs
1. In the upper course there is more vertical erosion.
The river cuts downwards into the valley because of
the steep gradient (slopes).
2. If there are areas of hard rock which are harder to
erode, the river will bend around it.
3. The river erodes around the areas of hard rock by
hydraulic action- the force of the moving water
pushes into cracks in the river bed and banks,
making the cracks wider.
4. This creates interlocking spurs of land which link
together like the teeth of a zip.

Floodplains
1. A floodplain is an area of land in the lower course
of a river which is covered in water when a river
bursts its banks.
2. In normal conditions (no flood) a river transports
sediment by processes such as suspension, when
small particles of sediment are carried along in the
moving flow of the water.
3. During a flood, material being carried by the river is
deposited on the land on either side of the river
(because the river loses its speed and energy to
transport material).
4. Over time, the height of the floodplain increases as
material is deposited on either side of the river.

Levees
1. Levees occur in the lower course of a river when
there is an increase in the volume of water flowing
downstream and flooding occurs.
2. When the river floods, the sediment that the river
was transporting spreads out across the floodplain.
3. The river loses energy because it slows down when
it spill over onto the floodplain. The largest material
is deposited first on the sides of the river banks
because it is the heaviest, and smaller lighter
material is carried further away from the river.
4. After many floods, the larger sediment builds up to
increase the height of the river banks, meaning that
the channel can carry more water. These raised
banks are called levees.

Deltas
1. Deltas form at the mouth of a river in the lower
course the river meets the sea.
2. When the river water meets the large body of
ocean water it suddenly loses speed and slows
down.
3. The river loses energy because it slows down which
causes deposition of sediment it was transporting
by suspension, and solution- dissolved particles of
sediment carried in the river water.
4. The deposition of sediment builds up and forms
islands in the middle of the river channel. The river
splits into distributaries as it tries to move around
these new islands to make its way into the sea.

### Erosional AND depositional landforms
```
Meanders
1. Meanders form in the middle course of a river where more water is added, and the river begins to get wider.
2. As a river flows around an obstacle such as an area of harder rock, most of the water is pushed towards the
outside. This causes increased speed and therefore increased erosion (through hydraulic action and abrasion).
3. The lateral erosion on the outside bend causes undercutting of the bank to form a river cliff.
4. Water on the inner bend is slower, causing the water to slow down and deposit the eroded material, creating
a gentle slope of sand and shingle. The build-up of deposited sediment is known as a slip-off slope.

Oxbow Lakes
1. Due to erosion on the outside bend of a meander, and deposition on the inside bend, the shape of a meander
will change over time.
2. Erosion narrows the neck of the land within the meander and as the process continues, the meanders move
closer together. This is through erosional processes such as hydraulic action and abrasion.
3. When there is a very high discharge (usually during a flood), the river cuts across the neck, taking a new,
straighter and shorter route.
4. Deposition will occur in the shallower parts to cut off the original meander, leaving a horseshoe-shaped
oxbow lake.
