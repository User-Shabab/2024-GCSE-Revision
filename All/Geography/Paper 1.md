## Section A - Hazardous Earth

### Atmospheric Cells
```
Hadley: Equator, Air rises
Ferrel: 30-60 degrees N & S
Polar: 60-90 degrees N & S

Air.fall == pressure++, rain--
Air.rise == pressure--, rain++
```

### Climate Change

#### Causes
```
Natural {
  Milankovitch cycles
  Volcanic Activity
  Surface Impacts
  Sunspot Activity }

Human {
  Deforestation
  Agriculture
  Burning fossil fuels }
```

#### Evidence
```
Natural {
  Tree rings
  Ice cores
  Historical sources }

Human {
  Sea level rise
  Increase in air temperature
  Melting ice sheets }
```

### Tropical Cyclones

#### Conditions and Location
```
Water temperatures above 26.5°C
Form around the ITCZ
Coriolis force provides the cyclone with the spin
```

### Case Studies

#### Developing Country: The Philippines

Tropical Cyclones

**November 2013**

```
Preparation {
  Japan helped to track the typhoon
  750,000 residents were evacuated 2 days before the typhoon hit
  The USA sent their military to help prepare the country
  Emergency shelters were not high enough to escape flooding }

Responses {
  7 regions were placed under a ‘State of National Calamity’
  Roads were blocked and damage to airports slowed relief efforts
  The UK provided medicine for 800,000 people
  The United Nations sent £480 million }
```

#### Developed Country: The USA

Tropical Cyclones

**August 2005**

```
Preparation {
  Forecasting and tracking was very good
  80% of New Orleans were evacuated
  The Superdome stadium was used as emergency shelter
  Flood defences did not work and 80% of New Orleans was flooded }

Responses {
  $14 billion was spent on improving flood defences
  FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) helped rehome 700,000 families
  The emergency services were slow and unprepared
  The UK government sent food aid }
```

## Section B - Development Dynamics

### Case Studies

#### China - MIC//Emerging
```
Language(s): Chinese, Mongolian, Uyghur...
GDP: ~US$ 18000 bn
How many countries it borders: 14
Land area: ~9,500,000 km²
Population: ~1,400,000,000
Power in control: Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Xi Jinping

- How has China’s location caused rapid economic development?
Huge land area: Supplies of many natural resources
Borders 14 other countries: access for trade links
Has a long coastline in the East. Access to ports for global trade

- Political and cultural factors that caused rapid economic development
Many Chinese people grew up in poverty and have strong desire to improve quality of life for
themselves and their family
Chinese people work extremely hard to succeed in education and later on in world of work
The Chinese Communist Party has 82 million members
This means the party is very well organised in getting its message across
Due to a lack of free speech or media, the governments’ decisions are always portrayed as correct ones

- How has globalisation (more connections with the wider world) caused rapid economic change?
Huge labour supply of 1.4bn people prepared to work long hours for low wages.
Government incentives such as SEZs where there are tax breaks and priority treatment to foreign firms.
FDI from Trans-National Companies (TNCs) provide
Chinese government invested in infrastructure like ports, roads, railways allowing better transport and trade facilities
Better access to a domestic market of 1.3bn and regional market of 4bn consumers.

- Positive impacts of economic growth
Infrastructure: From the late 1990s to 2005, 100 million Chinese
benefited from power and telecommunications upgrades.

TNCs create jobs for the local population lifting many families out of
poverty. China’s poverty rate (less than $1.25 per day) has fallen from 85
to 13% since TNCs started moving in.

TNCs bring with them modern technology and expertise to reduce harmful pollution
and create a safe working environment.

Tax: companies bring much needed money into China. Greater tax
revenues from TNCs can be spent on public services such as schools and hospitals.


- Negative impacts of economic growth
Working conditions: Huge expectations are placed on workers to endure long
shifts in difficult conditions. This can cause severe stress and depression. In 2010
18 Apple employees at Foxconn in Shenzen committed suicide in just one year.

TNC wages paid to local workers are often low ($0.50- $2 per hour) and some
companies have been accused of exploiting the local workforce rather than benefiting it.

Environmental impacts: China uses large amounts of coal and oil to power its
factories, releasing CO2 into the atmosphere which contributes to global warming.
In 2017, 14,000 TNCs were found to be breaking water and air pollution laws in
China. This has led to a rise in cancer cases across the country.

- How has rapid economic growth changed the international role of the emerging country?
International organisations: China joined the United Nations in 1971,
the World Bank in 1980 and World Trade Organisation in 2001. It’s memberships of international
organisations is increasing its global reach.

Exploiting African countries: China’s trade with Africa is worth $200 billion.
In return China gets very cheap resources and labour. African countries get into more debt
when they have to manufacture equipment back from China.

Military: Taiwan thinks it is independent. Currently China has 1,600 missiles pointed at targets in Taiwan.

Military: China is having disputes with other countries such as Japan and Spratly and Paracel islands
about how much of the East China sea it owns and is allowed to patrol.

#### Myanmar - LIC//Developing
```
Language(s): Burmese, Bengali, Khmer, Chinese...
GDP: ~US$ 75 bn
How many countries it borders: 5
Land area: ~680,000 km²
Population: ~55,000,000
Power in control:  National League for Democracy (NLD) party leader Aung San Suu Kyi
