### Characters

#### Macbeth
```
-Tragic Hero; descent from a revered and quintessential scottish soldier to a condemned and tyrannical leader
-Consequence of his hamartia: unchecked ambition making him innately flawed.
-Susceptible to the manipulation of his wife to protect his fragile masculinity
-His kingship and superficially strong will to commit regicide is testament to his idealised masculinity.
-Ideals of power, valour and violence become synonymous with his ideal masculinity which is toxic and repressive
-Driven by corrupt temptation stemmed from his inherent ambition.
-The antithesis of King Duncan, a nurturing and moral leader
-The antithesis of Malcolm who is the rightful leader and thus the archetype of order and purity - peace.
-Hubristic and grows a dependency on the witch's ambiguous and misleading prophecies.
