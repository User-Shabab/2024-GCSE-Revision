which o'erleaps itself and falls on the other"

### Beginning Analysis

**"Unseamed him from the nave to the chops and fixed his head upon our battlements"**

```
Violence - He's an expert at it (brutal)
Lady Macbeth - How she wants to like a 'valiant warrior' so 'unsex'es herself
Supernatural - Witches pick him (!Banquo) coz he's bloodthirsty
```

### Ending Analysis

**dead butcher** and **fiend-like queen**

```
Masculinity - How becoming masculine turned L.Mac into a fiend
Supernatural - Chosen him since he's like one (and king to butcher) - good riddance from society
Supernatural - She is witch-like, made subhuman through interference/traficking with supernatural
L.Macbeth - Perhaps he responsible for her death since he's a butcher (no concern for who he kills)
```

### Characters

#### Macbeth
```
-Tragic Hero; descent from a revered and quintessential scottish soldier to a condemned and tyrannical leader
-Consequence of his hamartia: unchecked ambition making him innately flawed.
-Susceptible to the manipulation of his wife to protect his fragile masculinity
-His kingship and superficially strong will to commit regicide is testament to his idealised masculinity.
-Ideals of power, valour and violence become synonymous with his ideal masculinity which is toxic and repressive
-Driven by corrupt temptation stemmed from his inherent ambition.
-The antithesis of King Duncan, a nurturing and moral leader
-The antithesis of Malcolm who is the rightful leader and thus the archetype of order and purity - peace.
-Hubristic and grows a dependency on the witch's ambiguous and misleading prophecies.

poverty.

# Paper 2

## Section A: An Inspector Calls (JB Priestley)

### Thesis statement
```
In AIC, Priestly wants to chane the attitude of the audience towards social responsibility; he wants
the upper classes to take responsibility for the workers and the poor and hence produce a fairer society.
He also focusses on female victims like Eva and Sheila to show that capitalism is also sexist and this
patriarchal society needs to change to respect to respect women.
The attack on capitalism also equates the motive with the desire to treat men as goods in order to earn
profit in war.
