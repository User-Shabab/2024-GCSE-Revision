Macbeth
Tragic Hero: inexorable descent from a revered and quintessential scottish soldier to a condemned and tyrannical leader as a consequence of his hamartia: unchecked ambition making him innately flawed.
Susceptible to the manipulation of his wife to protect his fragile masculinity (emasculation)- his kingship and superficially strong will to commit regicide is a testament to his idealised masculinity Ideals of power, valour and violence become synonymous with his ideal masculinity which is toxic and repressive
Driven by corrupt temptation stemmed from his inherent ambition.
The antithesis of King Duncan, a nurturing and moral leader, and Malcolm who is the rightful leader and thus the archetype of order and purity - peace. Hubristic and grows a dependency on the witch's ambiguous and misleading prophecies.
Key quotes:
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
"Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my hand. stars hide your fires, let not light see my black and deep desires." That function is smothered surmise and nothing is but what is not."
For Brave Macbeth... disdaining fortune with his brandished shield which smoked with bloody execution."
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair.. Make my seated heart knock at my ribs." Roman fool."
This tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongue."
I grant him bloody, Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin That has a name
'hell-hound' 'dead butcher."
James I was a King who faced heavy resentment from the Catholic population of England-1603 Gunpowder plot
Anti-monarchical views incentivised him to alter the view of his kingship and thus
became a patron of Shakespeare's Theatre group - the audience feared they would face the fate unfortunate fate of Macbeth if they do turn to corrupt temptation and perform such malpractices to overthrow the King
Exaggerated view of his importance, the slightest of blame for the both Macbeth's psychological turmoil and the violence and disorder in threats to his kingship warrants ruthless and
Macbeth becomes a vessel for the witch's supernatural malpractices - witches were to
compulsive bloodshed.
Epitome of guilt, paranoia and remorse which foregrounds him as a nihilistic figure almost instantaneously after his act of regicide but also in the end during his anagnorisis - alleviates the audience's
catharsis.
Referred to as tyrant - his epithet
Scotland - Catholics were often accused of Witchcraft and thus further provided stability to his Protestant kingship - this conception of witches was inextricably linked with james' ideology of witchcraft that resided in his famous book 'Demonologie' - the science of witches.
idea of female superiority// could also be used to condemn the idealised toxic and the unconventional dynamics in the Macbeths' relationship is used to condemn the repressive masculinity in Jacobean society that leads to a flawed perception of what it is to be a man.
