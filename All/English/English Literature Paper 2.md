## Section A: An Inspector Calls (JB Priestley)

### Thesis statement
```
In AIC, Priestly wants to chane the attitude of the audience towards social responsibility; he wants
the upper classes to take responsibility for the workers and the poor and hence produce a fairer society.
He also focusses on female victims like Eva and Sheila to show that capitalism is also sexist and this
patriarchal society needs to change to respect women.
The attack on capitalism also equates the motive with the desire to treat men as goods in order to earn profit in war.
