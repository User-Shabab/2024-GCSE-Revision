## Specialised cells

### Sperm Cells
```
Long tail and streamlined to help it swim
Lot of mitochondria in middle section for energy
Acrosome in head to digest through egg cell membrane
```

### Nerve Cells (animals)
```
Long to cover great distance
Branched connections at ends to form network
```

### Muscle Cells (animals)
```
Long hence more space to contract
Lots of mitochondria for energy for contraction
```

### Root Hair Cells (plants)
```
Long hairs hence big surface area
Thin cell wall allows quicker absorption rates
```

### Phloem and Xylem Cells (plants)
```
Cells are long and joined end to end
Xylem is hollow and phloem have few sub-cellular structures
Substances can easily flow through them
```

## Exchange substances

### Alveoli
```

```

```

### Leaves
```

Have spaces inside for larger surface area
Guard cells maintain income of gases
```

# Topic 2 - Organisation

## Cell Organisation

```
Cell - Basic building blocks of life
Tissue - A group of similar cells working together to carry out a particular function
Organs - A group of different tissues that work together to perform a certain function
Organ Systems - A group of organs working together to perform a particular function
Organism - Any living thing
```

## The Heart

### Structure
```
Heart is made of muscle tissue
Four chambers: Right and Left atrium (top), Right and Left ventricle (bottom)
Vena Cava: Deoxygenated blood, From body to heart
Aorta: Oxygenated blood, From heart to body
Pulmonary Vein: Oxygenated blood, From lungs to heart
Pulmonary Artery: Vena Cava: Deoxygenated blood, From heart to lungs
```

### How blood flows in heart
```
Blood from the pulmonary veins. enters the left atrium.
The atria fill, followed by the ventricles close ventricle.
The lower chamber of the heart that receives blood from the atrium and pumps it into arteries.
Blood is prevented from flowing back into the atria by heart valves.
```

## Blood Vessels

**Arteries**
```
Elastic fibres allow the artery wall to expand around blood surging through at high pressure when the heart contracts, fibres recoil when heart relaxes – this with a narrow lumen maintains high blood pressure
```

**Capillaries**
```
The wall is only one cell thick – this reduces the diffusion distance for oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the tissues of the body
The cells of the wall have gaps called pores which allow blood plasma to leak out and form tissue fluid
```

**Veins**
```
The wall of the vein is relatively thin with thinner layers of collagen, smooth muscle and elastic fibres
The lumen of the vein is much larger than that of an artery
Veins contain valves that prevent the backflow of blood, helping return blood to the heart
```

## The Blood

### Red blood cells
```
Red blood cells are cells with a distinctive biconcave disc shape
This shape is a result of Red blood cells not having a nucleus
Biconcave shape gives Red blood cells large surface to volume ratio; is a key adaptation to maximise efficiency of diffusion of gases in and out of cell

The cytoplasm of a Red blood cell is packed with the protein haemoglobin
Oxygen binds reversibly with haemoglobin, forming the red pigment oxyhaemoglobin:
oxygen + haemoglobin ⇌ oxyhaemoglobin
```

### White blood cells
```
White blood cells are part of the immune system, responsible for defending the body from infection by recognising and destroying pathogens
WBCs defend the body in three particular ways:
Phagocytes engulf and digest pathogens, destroying them
Lymphocytes produce specific antibodies that help enhance phagocyte activity by sticking them together (clumping) or disabling pathogens
Some lymphocytes produce a type of antibody called an antitoxin which is able to bind to toxic substances produced by pathogens, neutralising them

White blood cells have a variety of adaptations:
Phagocytes have a lobed nucleus and are autonomous - they leave the blood and patrol the tissues
Lymphocytes have a large nucleus and can produce antibodies extremely quickly
```

### Platelets
```
Platelets are fragments of cells (they contain cytoplasm but no nucleus)
When damage to a blood vessel occurs, the platelets are involved in forming a blood clot to prevent blood loss
Individuals with insufficient platelets cannot clot their blood effectively – this can be life-threatening if excessive damage occurs
```

### Plasma
```
Plasma is a watery fluid in which holds all the components of blood flow
Plasma carries platelets, red and white blood cells, carbon dioxide, digested food including glucose, amino acids and soluble nutrients, urea, hormones, antibodies, antitoxins, proteins and heat energy
```

## Plant Cell

### Organisation
```
Epidermal tissue : This covers whole plant
Palisade mesophyll: Part of leaf where photosynthesis happens
Spongy mesophyll: Contain big air spaces for gas diffusion
Xylem and Phloem: Transport substances
Meristem: At tips of shoots and roots for growth
```

### Factors affecting transpiration rate
```
Light intensity
Temperature
Humidity
Air flow
```

## CHD

### Stents Treatment
```
A narrow tube is threaded up through the groin up to the blocked vessel
A tiny balloon is then inflated
The balloon pushes the metal or plastic stent against the wall of the artery, increasing the width of the lumen
The balloon and tube are then removed

Good{
Short time
Very effective at reducing the risk of a heart attack as they widen the lumen to increase blood flow to the coronary arteries
The procedure is relatively simple
Last a long time}

Bad{
Expensive
A risk of blood clots (thrombosis) occurring around}
```

### Statin Treatment
```
Statins are drugs that are widely used to reduce the levels of fatty deposits (cholesterol) in the blood
They block an enzyme in the liver which is needed to make cholesterol
This slows down the rate of fatty material building up in the blood, reducing the risk of CHD occurring

Good{
Reduce levels of bad cholesterol
Increase levels of good cholesterol}

Bad{
Must be taken regularly
Long term
Can have side effects}
```

## Photosynthesis

### Use of glucose in plants

- [ ] Respiration
- [ ] Making cellulose
- [ ] Making amino acids
- [ ] Stored as oils//fats (to lipids for storing in seeds)
- [ ] Stored as starch (stored for later)

### Limiting Factors on rate of photosynthesis
- [ ] Light
- [ ] Number of chlorophyll
- [ ] Carbon dioxide concentration
- [ ] Temperature

## Respirations

### Aerobic

With oxygen. Equation below is used by both plants and animals.

```
Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon Dioxide + Water
```

### Anaerobic

Without oxygen. Provides less energy.

Humans:
```
Glucose → Lactic acid
```

Plants and Yeast (fermentation):
```
Glucose → Ethanol + Carbon Dioxide
```
