## Section B - Development Dynamics

### Case Studies

#### China - MIC//Emerging
```
Language(s): Chinese, Mongolian, Uyghur...
GDP: ~US$ 18000 bn
How many countries it borders: 14
Land area: ~9,500,000 km²
Population: ~1,400,000,000
Power in control: Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Xi Jinping

- How has China’s location caused rapid economic development?
Huge land area: Supplies of many natural resources
Borders 14 other countries: access for trade links
Has a long coastline in the East. Access to ports for global trade

- Political and cultural factors that caused rapid economic development
Many Chinese people grew up in poverty and have strong desire to improve quality of life for
themselves and their family
Chinese people work extremely hard to succeed in education and later on in world of work
The Chinese Communist Party has 82 million members
This means the party is very well organised in getting its message across
Due to a lack of free speech or media, the governments’ decisions are always portrayed as correct ones

- How has globalisation (more connections with the wider world) caused rapid economic change?
Huge labour supply of 1.4bn people prepared to work long hours for low wages.
Government incentives such as SEZs where there are tax breaks and priority treatment to foreign firms.
FDI from Trans-National Companies (TNCs) provide
Chinese government invested in infrastructure like ports, roads, railways allowing better transport and trade facilities
Better access to a domestic market of 1.3bn and regional market of 4bn consumers.

- Positive impacts of economic growth
Infrastructure: From the late 1990s to 2005, 100 million Chinese
benefited from power and telecommunications upgrades.

TNCs create jobs for the local population lifting many families out of
poverty. China’s poverty rate (less than $1.25 per day) has fallen from 85
to 13% since TNCs started moving in.

TNCs bring with them modern technology and expertise to reduce harmful pollution
and create a safe working environment.

Tax: companies bring much needed money into China. Greater tax
revenues from TNCs can be spent on public services such as schools and hospitals.


- Negative impacts of economic growth
Working conditions: Huge expectations are placed on workers to endure long
shifts in difficult conditions. This can cause severe stress and depression. In 2010
18 Apple employees at Foxconn in Shenzen committed suicide in just one year.

TNC wages paid to local workers are often low ($0.50- $2 per hour) and some
companies have been accused of exploiting the local workforce rather than benefiting it.

Environmental impacts: China uses large amounts of coal and oil to power its
factories, releasing CO2 into the atmosphere which contributes to global warming.
In 2017, 14,000 TNCs were found to be breaking water and air pollution laws in
China. This has led to a rise in cancer cases across the country.

- How has rapid economic growth changed the international role of the emerging country?
International organisations: China joined the United Nations in 1971,
the World Bank in 1980 and World Trade Organisation in 2001. It’s memberships of international
organisations is increasing its global reach.

Exploiting African countries: China’s trade with Africa is worth $200 billion.
In return China gets very cheap resources and labour. African countries get into more debt
when they have to manufacture equipment back from China.

Military: Taiwan thinks it is independent. Currently China has 1,600 missiles pointed at targets in Taiwan.

Military: China is having disputes with other countries such as Japan and Spratly and Paracel islands
about how much of the East China sea it owns and is allowed to patrol.

## Processes of Erosion
```
Hydraulic Action- water pushes into cracks in rocks
Attrition- rocks hit against each other
Abrasion – rocks rub/scrape against cliffs
Solution – weakly acidic sea water dissolves rocks
```

## Processes of Transportation
```
Traction – rocks roll along the sea floor
Saltation – rocks bounce along the sea floor
Suspension – rocks are held up and carried in waves
Solution – sediment is dissolved and carried in the waves
```

## Processes of Deposition
```
Deposition – occurs when waves lose energy (wind speed drops)
and drop sediment they are carrying
```

## Landforms

### Coasts

#### Erosional
```
Cave, arch, stack, stump
1. Waves erode cracks in a headland by hydraulic
action- the force of the waves pushes into the
cracks, widening them, forming caves.
2. Erosion of the back of the cave by abrasion will
cause it to break through to the other side of the
headland forming an arch.
3. The top of the arch is weakened by further erosion
and weathering. It becomes unstable and collapses
leaving behind a pillar of rock called a stack.
4. Erosion of the base of the stack will cause it to fall
over forming a stump.

Wave-cut platform and cliffs
1. At high tide, waves will erode the bottom of a cliff
by hydraulic action- when the force of the waves
pushes into cracks in the cliff, widening them.
2. Over time this forms a wave-cut notch at the base
of the cliff- like an ice-cream scoop along the
bottom of the cliff.
3. This undercuts the cliff above, which will become
unstable as the wave-cut notch gets bigger. The cliff
will eventually collapse.
4. This process repeats over time, leaving behind a
rocky platform that is exposed at low tide called a
wave-cut platform, with a steep cliff behind it.

Headlands and bays
1. Headlands and bays form on discordant coastlines
where there are alternating bands of hard and soft
rock arranges perpendicular (at right angles) to the
coastline.
2. The bands of softer rock are less resistant, so they
erode faster due to processes like abrasion, when
rocks rub against the cliffs wearing them away like
sandpaper.
3. The erosion of the softer rock forms bays, which are
sheltered areas of the coast where beaches form.
4. The harder bands of rock are more resistant to
erosion so they erode slowly, and are left sticking
out to sea forming headlands.
```

#### Depositional
```
Beach
1. Beaches form due to transportation and deposition
in sheltered areas of the coastlines like bays.
2. Wind speed is lower in bays, therefore waves have
low energy, and are usually constructive waves.
3. Constructive waves have a weak backwash and a
strong swash, which means that sediment carried
in the waves by suspension (when sediment is held
up and carried in waves) can be deposited as the
swash moves towards the coast.
4. Sediment and sand is deposited on the coastline,
over time building up to form a beach.

Spit
1. A spit begins to form when longshore drift
transports sediment along the coastline. The wind
pushes the swash of a wave up the beach at an
angle, and the backwash moves straight back out to
sea due to gravity.
2. This process repeats and sediment is transported
along the coast in a zig-zag pattern.
3. When longshore drift reaches a bend in the
coastline, wind speed drops and the waves lose
energy. This cause deposition of sediment to occur.
4. Over time, more sediment is transported and
deposited which results in the formation of a long
ridge of sand sticking out to sea called a spit.

Bar
1. A bar begins to form when longshore drift
transports sediment along the coastline. The wind
pushes the swash of a wave up the beach at an
angle, and the backwash moves straight back out to
sea due to gravity.
2. This process repeats and sediment is transported
along the coast in a zig-zag pattern.
3. When longshore drift reaches a bend in the
coastline, wind speed drops and the waves lose
energy. This cause deposition of sediment to occur.
4. As more sediment is deposited, a spit forms. If the
spit connects to another headland this forms a bar,
with a lagoon of trapped water behind it.

# Paper 3

### Biome comparisons
```
Taiga = cold and dry
Rainforest = hot and wet

Taiga = Litter is the largest nutrient store
Rainforest = biomass is the largest nutrient store

Taiga = thick fur
Rainforest = prehensile tail

Taiga = cone shaped trees
Rainforest = drip tips
```

### 4 Markers 'Explain' questions

#### "How the interdependence of abiotic and biotic components leads to low productivity in the Taiga biome"
```
METHOD 1:
An abiotic component in the Taiga is the
climate. Colder temperatures and low
rainfall means that decomposition of
litter is slow (1). This leads to a large
store of nutrients retained in the litter,
and less in the soil which results in less
plant growth (1).

A biotic component in the Taiga is the
flora (plants). Only a few species of
plants can survive in the Taiga (1)
because of extreme low temperatures
and low levels of sunlight (1).

METHOD 2:
One reason why the Taiga forest
has low productivity is the
climate is very cold (1). This
means that decomposition of
litter is very slow, so more
nutrients are stored in the litter
on the forest floor (1).

Another reason is because there
are low sunlight levels in the
Taiga (1). This means that
biodiversity is low as plants find
it difficult to grow in harsh
conditions (1).
