## Section A - Hazardous Earth

### Atmospheric Cells
```
Hadley: Equator, Air rises
Ferrel: 30-60 degrees N & S
Polar: 60-90 degrees N & S

Air.fall == pressure++, rain--
Air.rise == pressure--, rain++
```

### Climate Change

#### Causes
```
Natural {
  Milankovitch cycles
  Volcanic Activity
  Surface Impacts
  Sunspot Activity }

Human {
  Deforestation
  Agriculture
  Burning fossil fuels }
```

#### Evidence
```
Natural {
  Tree rings
  Ice cores
  Historical sources }

Human {
  Sea level rise
  Increase in air temperature }
```

### Tropical Cyclones

#### Conditions and Location
```
Water temperatures above 26.5°C
Form around the ITCZ
Coriolis force provides the cyclone with the spin
```

#### Case Studies

##### Developing Country: The Philippines

November 2013

```
Preparation {
  Japan helped to track the typhoon
  750,000 residents were evacuated 2 days before the typhoon hit
  The USA sent their military to help prepare the country
  Emergency shelters were not high enough to escape flooding }

Responses {
  7 regions were placed under a ‘State of National Calamity’
  Roads were blocked and damage to airports slowed relief efforts
  The UK provided medicine for 800,000 people
  The United Nations sent £480 million }
```

##### Developed Country: The USA

August 2005

```
Preparation {
  Forecasting and tracking was very good
  80% of New Orleans were evacuated
  The Superdome stadium was used as emergency shelter
  Flood defences did not work and 80% of New Orleans was flooded }

Responses {
  $14 billion was spent on improving flood defences
  FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) helped rehome 700,000 families
  The emergency services were slow and unprepared
  The UK government sent food aid }
```

### Biome comparisons
```
Taiga = cold and dry
Rainforest = hot and wet

Taiga = Litter is the largest nutrient store
Rainforest = biomass is the largest nutrient store

Taiga = thick fur
Rainforest = prehensile tail

Taiga = cone shaped trees
Rainforest = drip tips
```

### 4 Markers 'Explain' questions

#### "How the interdependence of abiotic and biotic components leads to low productivity in the Taiga biome"
```
METHOD 1:
An abiotic component in the Taiga is the
climate. Colder temperatures and low
rainfall means that decomposition of
litter is slow (1). This leads to a large
store of nutrients retained in the litter,
and less in the soil which results in less
plant growth (1).

A biotic component in the Taiga is the
flora (plants). Only a few species of
plants can survive in the Taiga (1)
because of extreme low temperatures
and low levels of sunlight (1).

METHOD 2:
One reason why the Taiga forest
has low productivity is the
climate is very cold (1). This
means that decomposition of
litter is very slow, so more
nutrients are stored in the litter
on the forest floor (1).

Another reason is because there
are low sunlight levels in the
Taiga (1). This means that
biodiversity is low as plants find
it difficult to grow in harsh
conditions (1).
