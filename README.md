# Notes for GCSE
Coding study notes for more efficient revision.

## Description

Notes made on this code (file: ). Once a topic asked for, it will provide the material needed for memorising. Mainly for AQA and for these subjects:
- Biology
- Chemistry
- Physics

Once those done, then will hopefully add in:

- English
- Computer Science
- Mathematics

Many students revise digitally, so if a program can be made, there won't need to be a pile of papers in the abyss of a backpack.

First a text version. Soon a GUI.
