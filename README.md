# Science Notes for GCSE
Coding study notes for more efficient revision.

## Description

Notes made on this code. Once a topic asked for, it will provide the material needed for memorising. Mainly for AQA and for these subjects:
- Biology
- Chemistry
- Physics

Once those done, then will hopefully add in:

- English
- Computer Science
- Mathematics

Most of us students always work on the laptop or computer, so if a program can be made, there won't be a pile of papers in the abyss of a backpack.

First a text version. Soon a GUI.
